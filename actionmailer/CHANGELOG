    end
    
    def unencoded_subject(recipient)
      @recipients = recipient
      @subject    = "testing unencoded subject"

  This is especially useful for functional testing that shouldn't send off real emails, but still trigger delivery_* methods.

  Sendmail is assumed to be present at "/usr/sbin/sendmail" if that option is used. [Kent Sibilev]
