*Rails 3.0.0 (August 29, 2010)*

* subject is automatically looked up on I18n using mailer_name and action_name as scope as in t(".subject") [JK]

* Changed encoding behaviour of mail, so updated tests in actionmailer and bumped mail version to 2.2.1 [ML]

* Added ability to pass Proc objects to the defaults hash [ML]

* Removed all quoting.rb type files from ActionMailer and put Mail 2.2.0 in instead [ML]

* Lot of updates to various test cases that now work better with the new Mail and so have different expectations

* Added interceptors and observers from Mail [ML]

    ActionMailer::Base.register_interceptor calls Mail.register_interceptor
    ActionMailer::Base.register_observer calls Mail.register_observer

* Mail::Part now no longer has nil as a default charset, it is always set to something, and defaults to UTF-8

* Added explict setting of charset in set_fields! method to make sure Mail has the user defined default

* Removed quoting.rb and refactored for Mail to take responsibility of all quoting and auto encoding requirements for the header.

* Fixed several tests which had incorrect encoding.

* Changed all utf-8 to UTF-8 for consistency

* Whole new API added with tests.  See base.rb for full details.  Old API is deprecated.

* The Mail::Message class has helped methods for all the field types that return 'common' defaults for the common use case, so to get the subject, mail.subject will give you a string, mail.date will give you a DateTime object, mail.from will give you an array of address specs (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) etc.  If you want to access the field object itself, call mail[:field_name] which will return the field object you want, which you can then chain, like mail[:from].formatted

* Mail#content_type now returns the content_type field as a string. If you want the mime type of a mail, then you call Mail#mime_type (eg, text/plain), if you want the parameters of the content type field, you call Mail#content_type_parameters which gives you a hash, eg {'format' => 'flowed', 'charset' => 'utf-8'}

* ActionMailer::Base :default_implicit_parts_order now is in the sequence of the order you want, no reversing of ordering takes place.  The default order now is text/plain, then text/enriched, then text/html and then any other part that is not one of these three.

* Mail does not have "quoted_body", "quoted_subject" etc.  All of these are accessed via body.encoded, subject.encoded etc

* Every object in a Mail object returns an object, never a string.  So Mail.body returns a Mail::Body class object, need to call #encoded or #decoded to get the string you want.
* Mail::Message#set_content_type does not exist, it is simply Mail::Message#content_type

* Every mail message gets a unique message_id unless you specify one, had to change all the tests that check for equality with expected.encoded == actual.encoded to first replace their message_ids with control values

* Mail now has a proper concept of parts, remove the ActionMailer::Part and ActionMailer::PartContainer classes

* Calling #encoded on any object returns it as a string ready to go into the output stream of an email, this means it includes the \r\n at the end of the lines and the object is pre-wrapped with \r\n\t if it is a header field.  Also, the "encoded" value includes the field name if it is a header field.

* Attachments are only the actual attachment, with filename etc.  A part contains an attachment.  The part has the content_type etc.  So attachments.last.content_type is invalid.  But parts.last.content_type

* There is no idea of a "sub_head" in Mail.  A part is just a Message with some extra functionality, so it just has a "header" like a normal mail message

      @body       = "Nothing to see here."
      @charset    = "iso-8859-1"
    end

    def unencoded_subject(recipient)
      @recipients = recipient
      @subject    = "testing unencoded subject"
      @from       = "system@loudthinking.com"

    def post_notification(recipients, post)
      @recipients          = recipients
      @from                = post.author.email_address_with_name
      @headers["bcc"]      = SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL
      @headers["reply-to"] = "notifications@example.com"
      @subject             = "[#{post.account.name} #{post.title}]"
      @body["post"]        = post
    end

*0.4* (5)

* Consolidated the server configuration options into Base#server_settings= and expanded that with controls for authentication and more [Marten]
  NOTE: This is an API change that could potentially break your application if you used the old application form. Please do change!

* Added Base#deliveries as an accessor for an array of emails sent out through that ActionMailer class when using the :test delivery option. [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Base#perform_deliveries= which can be set to false to turn off the actual delivery of the email through smtp or sendmail.
  This is especially useful for functional testing that shouldn't send off real emails, but still trigger delivery_* methods.

* Added option to specify delivery method with Base#delivery_method=. Default is :smtp and :sendmail is currently the only other option.
  Sendmail is assumed to be present at "/usr/sbin/sendmail" if that option is used. [Kent Sibilev]

* Dropped "include TMail" as it added to much baggage into the default namespace (like Version) [Chad Fowler]


*0.3*

* First release
