Description:
============
    Stubs out a new mailer and its views. Passes the mailer name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of emails as arguments.

    This generates a mailer class in app/mailers and invokes your template
    engine and test framework generators.

Example:
========
    bin/rails generate mailer Notifications signup forgot_password invoice

    creates a Notifications mailer class, views, and test:
        Mailer:     app/mailers/notifications_mailer.rb
        Views:      app/views/notifications_mailer/signup.text.erb [...]
        Test:       test/mailers/notifications_mailer_test.rb
