# Action Cable â€“ Integrated WebSockets for \Rails

Action Cable seamlessly integrates WebSockets with the rest of your \Rails application.
It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the same style
and form as the rest of your \Rails application, while still being performant
and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a client-side
JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have access to your full
domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of choice.

You can read more about Action Cable in the [Action Cable Overview](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) guide.
