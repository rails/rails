  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

  The resources of the Rails team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

  If you can still reproduce this error on the `5-1-stable` branch or on `master`,
  please reply with all of the information you have about it in order to keep the issue open.

  Thank you for all your contributions.
