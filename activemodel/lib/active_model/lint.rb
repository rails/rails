    # == Active \Model \Lint \Tests
    #
    # You can test whether an object is compliant with the Active \Model API by
    # including +ActiveModel::Lint::Tests+ in your TestCase. It will
    # include tests that tell you whether your object is fully compliant,
    # or if not, which aspects of the API are not implemented.
    #
    # Note an object is not required to implement all APIs in order to work
    # with Action Pack. This module only intends to provide guidance in case
    # you want all features out of the box.
    #
    # These tests do not attempt to determine the semantic correctness of the
    # returned values. For instance, you could implement <tt>valid?</tt> to
    # always return +true+, and the tests would pass. It is up to you to ensure
    # that the values are semantically meaningful.
    #
    # Objects you pass in are expected to return a compliant object from a call
    # to <tt>to_model</tt>. It is perfectly fine for <tt>to_model</tt> to return
    # +self+.
    module Tests
      # Passes if the object's model responds to <tt>to_key</tt> and if calling
      # this method returns +nil+ when the object is not persisted.
      # Fails otherwise.
      #
      # <tt>to_key</tt> returns an Enumerable of all (primary) key attributes
      # of the model, and is used to a generate unique DOM id for the object.

      #
      # <tt>to_param</tt> is used to represent the object's key in URLs.
      # Implementers can decide to either raise an exception or provide a
      # default in case the record uses a composite primary key. There are no
      # tests for this behavior in lint because it doesn't make sense to force
      # any of the possible implementation strategies on the implementer.
