*   Backport `ActiveRecord::Normalization` to `ActiveModel::Attributes::Normalization`

    ```ruby
    class User
      include ActiveModel::Attributes
      include ActiveModel::Attributes::Normalization

      attribute :email, :string

      normalizes :email, with: -> email { email.strip.downcase }
    end

    user = User.new
    user.email =    " CRUISE-CONTROL@EXAMPLE.COM\n"
    user.email # => "cruise-control@example.com"
    ```
