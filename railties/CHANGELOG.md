    that are actually used by the `SessionsController` and `PasswordsController`

    Fixes #54233

    *Michael Duchemin*

*   Introduce `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` placeholder in generated ci.yml files

    *Steve Polito*

*   Colorize the Rails console prompt even on non standard environments.

*   Don't enable YJIT in development and test environments

    hence YJIT isn't generally faster in these environments.

    *Ali Ismayilov*, *Jean Boussier*

*   Only include PermissionsPolicy::Middleware if policy is configured.

    *Petrik de Heus*
