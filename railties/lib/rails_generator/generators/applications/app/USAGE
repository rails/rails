Description:
    The 'rails' command creates a new Rails application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    rails ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

    This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.

WARNING:
    Only specify --without-gems if you did not use gems to install Rails.
    Your application will expect to find activerecord, actionpack, and
    actionmailer directories in the vendor directory.  A popular way to track
    the bleeding edge of Rails development is to checkout from source control
    directly to the vendor directory.  See http://dev.rubyonrails.org/
