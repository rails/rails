Description:
    The resource generator creates an empty model and controller for use in a REST-friendly, resource-oriented
    application. Say you want to a resource called post. Normally, you could just call "script/generate model post" and
    "script/generate controller posts". This generator basically just collapses these two generators into one step.

    The generator takes the name of the model as its first argument. This model name is then pluralized to get the 
    controller name. So "resource post" will generate a Post model and a PostsController and will be intended
    for URLs like /posts and /posts/45.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs described by name and type. These attributes will
    be used to prepopulate the migration to create the table for the model and give you a set of predefined fixture.    
    You don't have to think up all attributes up front, but it's a good idea of adding just the baseline of what's 
    needed to start really working with the resource.

Examples:
    ./script/generate resource post
    ./script/generate resource post title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean
    ./script/generate resource purchase order_id:integer created_at:datetime amount:decimal
