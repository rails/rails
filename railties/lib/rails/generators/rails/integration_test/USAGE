Description:
    Generates a new integration test. Pass the name of the test, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, as an argument.

    This generator invokes the current integration tool, which defaults to
    TestUnit.

Example:
    `bin/rails generate integration_test GeneralStories` creates a GeneralStories
    integration test in test/integration/general_stories_test.rb
