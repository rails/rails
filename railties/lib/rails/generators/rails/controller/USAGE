Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its views. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,
    template engine, assets, and test framework generators.

Example:
    `bin/rails generate controller CreditCards open debit credit close`

    CreditCards controller with URLs like /credit_cards/debit.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Test:       test/controllers/credit_cards_controller_test.rb
        Views:      app/views/credit_cards/debit.html.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_cards_helper.rb
