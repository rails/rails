# Uncomment each configuration one by one to switch to the new default.
# Once your application is ready to run with all new defaults, you can remove

# Controls whether Active Job's `#perform_later` and similar methods automatically defer
# the job queuing to after the current Active Record transaction is committed.
#
# Example:
#   Topic.transaction do
#     topic = Topic.create(...)
#     NewTopicNotificationJob.perform_later(topic)
#   end
#
# In this example, if the configuration is set to `:never`, the job will
# be enqueued immediately, even though the `Topic` hasn't been committed yet.
# Because of this, if the job is picked up almost immediately, or if the
# transaction doesn't succeed for some reason, the job will fail to find this
# topic in the database.
#
# If `enqueue_after_transaction_commit` is set to `:default`, the queue adapter
# will define the behaviour.
#
# Note: Active Job backends can disable this feature. This is generally done by
# backends that use the same database as Active Record as a queue, hence they
# don't need this feature.

# Rails.application.config.active_job.enqueue_after_transaction_commit = :default

# Adds image/webp to the list of content types Active Storage considers as an image
# Prevents automatic conversion to a fallback PNG, and assumes clients support WebP, as they support gif, jpeg, and png.
# This is possible due to broad browser support for WebP, but older browsers and email clients may still not support
# WebP. Requires imagemagick/libvips built with WebP support.

###
# Enable validation of migration timestamps. When set, an ActiveRecord::InvalidMigrationTimestampError
# will be raised if the timestamp prefix for a migration is more than a day ahead of the timestamp
# associated with the current time. This is done to prevent forward-dating of migration files, which can
# impact migration generation and other migration commands.
#
# Applications with existing timestamped migrations that do not adhere to the
# expected format can disable validation by setting this config to `false`.
#++
# Rails.application.config.active_record.validate_migration_timestamps = true

###
# Controls whether Active Record will automatically look for inverse relations
# with a pluralized name.
#
# Example:
#   class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
#     belongs_to :post
#   end
#
# In this example, Active Record will try to infer a `:comment` (singular) association
# on `Post`. With this option enabled, it will also look for a `:comments` association.
#++
# Rails.application.config.active_record.automatically_invert_plural_associations = true

###
# Controls whether Active Support should log tests without assertions.
# This is helpful in detecting broken tests that do not perform intended assertions.
# To disable this behavior, set the value to `:ignore` inside the `config/application.rb` (NOT this file).
#
#++
# Rails.application.config.active_support.assertionless_tests_behavior = :log
