# Uncomment each configuration one by one to switch to the new default.

# Change the digest class for the key generators to `OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256`.
# Changing this default means invalidate all encrypted messages generated by
# your application and, all the encrypted cookies. Only change this after you
# rotated all the messages using the key rotator.
#
# See upgrading guide for more information on how to build a rotator.

# Calls `Rails.application.executor.wrap` around test cases.

# Several features that are normally disabled in test, such as Active Record query cache
# and asynchronous queries will then be enabled.
# Rails.application.config.active_support.executor_around_test_case = true

# Define the isolation level of most of Rails internal state.
# If you use a fiber based server or job processor, you should set it to `:fiber`.
# Otherwise the default of `:thread` if preferable.

# Protect from open redirect attacks in `redirect_back_or_to` and `redirect_to`.

# Change the variant processor for Active Storage.
# Changing this default means updating all places in your code that
# generate variants to use image processing macros and ruby-vips
# operations. See the upgrading guide for detail on the changes required.
# The `:mini_magick` option is not deprecated; it's fine to keep using it.

# Enable parameter wrapping for JSON.

# ** Please read carefully, this must be configured in config/application.rb **
# Change the format of the cache entry.
# Changing this default means that all new cache entries added to the cache
# will have a different format that is not supported by Rails 6.1 applications.
# Only change this value after your application is fully deployed to Rails 7.0
# and you have no plans to rollback.
# When you're ready to change format, add this to `config/application.rb` (NOT this file):
#  config.active_support.cache_format_version = 7.0


# Cookie serializer: 2 options
#
# If you're upgrading and haven't set `cookies_serializer` previously, your cookie serializer
# is `:marshal`. The default for new apps is `:json`.
#
# Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :json
#
#
# To migrate an existing application to the `:json` serializer, use the `:hybrid` option.
#
# Rails transparently deserializes existing (Marshal-serialized) cookies on read and
# re-writes them in the JSON format.
#
# It is fine to use `:hybrid` long term; you should do that until you're confident *all* your cookies
# have been converted to JSON. To keep using `:hybrid` long term, move this config to its own
# initializer or to `config/application.rb`.
#
# Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :hybrid
#
#
# If your cookies can't yet be serialized to JSON, keep using `:marshal` for backward-compatibility.
#
# If you have configured the serializer elsewhere, you can remove this section of the file.
#
# See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#cookies for more information.

# Active Storage `has_many_attached` relationships will default to replacing the current collection instead of appending to it.
# Thus, to support submitting an empty collection, the `file_field` helper will render an hidden field `include_hidden` by default when `multiple_file_field_include_hidden` is set to `true`.
# See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-active-storage-multiple-file-field-include-hidden for more information.
