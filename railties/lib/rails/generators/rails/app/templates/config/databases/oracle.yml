# Oracle/OCI 8i, 9, 10g

# Requires Ruby/OCI8:
#  http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-oci8/
#
# Specify your database using any valid connection syntax, such as a
# tnsnames.ora service name, or an SQL connect string of the form:
#
#   //host:[port][/service name]
#
# By default prefetch_rows (OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS) is set to 100. And
# until true bind variables are supported, cursor_sharing is set by default
# to 'similar'. Both can be changed in the configuration below; the defaults
# are equivalent to specifying:
#
#  prefetch_rows: 100
#  cursor_sharing: similar
#
default: &default
  adapter: oracle
  username: <%= app_name %>
  password:

development:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= app_name %>_development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= app_name %>_test

# Do not keep production credentials in the repository,
# instead read the configuration from the environment.
production:
  url: <%%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %>
