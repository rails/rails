# Action Cable provides the framework to deal with WebSockets in Rails. 
# You can generate new channels where WebSocket features live using the rails generate channel command.
#
# Turn on the cable connection by removing the comments after the require statements (and ensure it's also on in config/routes.rb).

#= require action_cable
#= require_self
#= require_tree ./channels

# @App ||= {}
# App.cable = ActionCable.createConsumer()
