Description:
    The Rails `runner` allows running Ruby code in the context of your application.

Examples:
    Run `puts Rails.env` after loading the app:

        <%= executable %> 'puts Rails.env'

    Run the Ruby file located at `path/to/filename.rb` after loading the app:

        <%= executable %> path/to/filename.rb

    Run the Ruby script read from stdin after loading the app:

        <%= executable %> -
<% unless Gem.win_platform? -%>

    You can also use the runner command as a shebang line for your executables:

        #!/usr/bin/env <%= File.expand_path(executable) %>
        Product.all.each { |p| p.price *= 2 ; p.save! }
<% end -%>
