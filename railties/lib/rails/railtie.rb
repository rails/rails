module Rails
  # +Rails::Railtie+ is the core of the \Rails framework and provides
  # several hooks to extend \Rails and/or modify the initialization process.
  #
  # Every major component of \Rails (Action Mailer, Action Controller, Active
  # Record, etc.) implements a railtie. Each of them is responsible for their
  # own initialization. This makes \Rails itself absent of any component hooks,
  # allowing other components to be used in place of any of the \Rails defaults.
  #
  # Developing a \Rails extension does _not_ require implementing a railtie, but
  # if you need to interact with the \Rails framework during or after boot, then
  # a railtie is needed.
  #
  # For example, an extension doing any of the following would need a railtie:
  #
  # * creating initializers
  # * configuring a \Rails framework for the application, like setting a generator
  # * adding <tt>config.*</tt> keys to the environment
  # * setting up a subscriber with ActiveSupport::Notifications
  # * adding Rake tasks
  #
  # == Creating a Railtie
  #
  # To extend \Rails using a railtie, create a subclass of +Rails::Railtie+.
  # This class must be loaded during the \Rails boot process, and is conventionally
  # called +MyNamespace::Railtie+.
  #
  # The following example demonstrates an extension which can be used with or
  # without \Rails.
  #
  #   # lib/my_gem/railtie.rb
  #   module MyGem
  #     class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # lib/my_gem.rb
  #   require "my_gem/railtie" if defined?(Rails::Railtie)
  #
  # == Initializers
  #
  # To add an initialization step to the \Rails boot process from your railtie, just
  # define the initialization code with the +initializer+ macro:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     initializer "my_gem.configure_rails_initialization" do
  #       # some initialization behavior
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # If specified, the block can also receive the application object, in case you
  # need to access some application-specific configuration, like middleware:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     initializer "my_gem.configure_rails_initialization" do |app|
  #       app.middleware.use MyGem::Middleware
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Finally, you can also pass <tt>:before</tt> and <tt>:after</tt> as options to
  # +initializer+, in case you want to couple it with a specific step in the
  # initialization process.
  #
  # == Configuration
  #
  # Railties can access a config object which contains configuration shared by all
  # railties and the application:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     # Customize the ORM
  #     config.app_generators.orm :my_gem_orm
  #
  #     # Add a to_prepare block which is executed once in production
  #     # and before each request in development.
  #     config.to_prepare do
  #       MyGem.setup!
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Loading Rake Tasks and Generators
  #
  # If your railtie has Rake tasks, you can tell \Rails to load them through the method
  # +rake_tasks+:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     rake_tasks do
  #       load "path/to/my_gem.tasks"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # By default, \Rails loads generators from your load path. However, if you want to place
  # your generators at a different location, you can specify in your railtie a block which
  # will load them during normal generators lookup:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     generators do
  #       require "path/to/my_gem_generator"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Since filenames on the load path are shared across gems, be sure that files you load
  # through a railtie have unique names.
  #
  # == Run another program when the \Rails server starts
  #
  # In development, it's very usual to have to run another process next to the \Rails Server. In example
  # you might want to start the Webpack or React server. Or maybe you need to run your job scheduler process
  # like Sidekiq. This is usually done by opening a new shell and running the program from here.
  #
  # \Rails allow you to specify a +server+ block which will get called when a \Rails server starts.
  # This way, your users don't need to remember to have to open a new shell and run another program, making
  # this less confusing for everyone.
  # It can be used like this:
  #
  #   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
  #     server do
  #       WebpackServer.start
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Application and Engine
  #
  # An engine is nothing more than a railtie with some initializers already set. And since
  # Rails::Application is an engine, the same configuration described here can be
  # used in both.
  #
  # Be sure to look at the documentation of those specific classes for more information.
