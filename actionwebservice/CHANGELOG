* Rename Version constant to VERSION. #2802 [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Fix that XML-RPC date/time values did not have well-defined behaviour (#2516, #2534). This fix has one caveat, in that we can't support pre-1970 dates from XML-RPC clients.

* Fix duplicate XSD entries for custom types shared across delegated/layered services #1729 [Tyler Kovacs]

* Allow multiple invocations in the same test method #1720 [dkhawk]

* Added ActionWebService::API::Base.soap_client and ActionWebService::API::Base.xmlrpc_client helper methods to create the internal clients for an API, useful for testing from ./script/console

* ActionWebService now always returns UTF-8 responses.


*0.8.1* (11 July, 2005)

* Fix scaffolding for Action Pack controller changes


*0.8.0* (6 July, 2005)

* Fix WSDL generation by aliasing #inherited instead of trying to overwrite it, or the WSDL action may end up not being defined in the controller

* Add ActionController::Base.wsdl_namespace option, to allow overriding of the namespace used in generated WSDL and SOAP messages. This is equivalent to the [WebService(Namespace = "Value")] attribute in .NET.

* Add workaround for Ruby 1.8.3's SOAP4R changing the return value of SOAP::Mapping::Registry#find_mapped_soap_class #1414 [Shugo Maeda]

* Fix moduled controller URLs in WSDL, and add unit test to verify the generated URL #1428

* Fix scaffolding template paths, it was broken on Win32

* Fix that functional testing of :layered controllers failed when using the SOAP protocol

* Allow invocation filters in :direct controllers as well, as they have access to more information regarding the web service request than ActionPack filters

* Add support for a :base64 signature type #1272 [Shugo Maeda]

* Fix that boolean fields were not rendered correctly in scaffolding

* Fix that scaffolding was not working for :delegated dispatching

* Add support for structured types as input parameters to scaffolding, this should let one test the blogging APIs using scaffolding as well

* Fix that generated WSDL was not using relative_url_root for base URI #1210 [Shugo Maeda]

* Use UTF-8 encoding by default for SOAP responses, but if an encoding is supplied by caller, use that for the response  #1211 [Shugo Maeda, NAKAMURA Hiroshi]

* If the WSDL was retrieved over HTTPS, use HTTPS URLs in the WSDL too

* Fix that casting change in 0.7.0 would convert nil values to the default value for the type instead of leaving it as nil


*0.7.1* (20th April, 2005)

* Depend on Active Record 1.10.1 and Action Pack 1.8.1


*0.7.0* (19th April, 2005)

* When casting structured types, don't try to send obj.name= unless obj responds to it, causes casting to be less likely to fail for XML-RPC

* Add scaffolding via ActionController::Base.web_service_scaffold for quick testing using a web browser

* ActionWebService::API::Base#api_methods now returns a hash containing ActionWebService::API::Method objects instead of hashes. However, ActionWebService::API::Method defines a #[]() backwards compatibility method so any existing code utilizing this will still work.

* The :layered dispatching mode can now be used with SOAP as well, allowing you to support SOAP and XML-RPC clients for APIs like the metaWeblog API

* Remove ActiveRecordSoapMarshallable workaround, see #912 for details

* Generalize casting code to be used by both SOAP and XML-RPC (previously, it was only XML-RPC)

* Ensure return value is properly cast as well, fixes XML-RPC interoperability with Ecto and possibly other clients

* Include backtraces in 500 error responses for failed request parsing, and remove "rescue nil" statements obscuring real errors for XML-RPC

* Perform casting of struct members even if the structure is already of the correct type, so that the type we specify for the struct member is always the type of the value seen by the API implementation


*0.6.2* (27th March, 2005)

* Allow method declarations for direct dispatching to declare parameters as well. We treat an arity of < 0 or > 0 as an indication that we should send through parameters. Closes #939.


*0.6.1* (22th March, 2005)

* Fix that method response QNames mismatched with that declared in the WSDL, makes SOAP::WSDLDriverFactory work against AWS again

* Fix that @request.env was being modified, instead, dup the value gotten from env

* Fix XML-RPC example to use :layered mode, so it works again

* Support casting '0' or 0 into false, and '1' or 1 into true, when expecting a boolean value

* Fix that SOAP fault response fault code values were not QName's #804


*0.6.0* (7th March, 2005)

* Add action_controller/test_invoke, used for integrating AWS with the Rails testing infrastructure

* Allow passing through options to the SOAP RPC driver for the SOAP client

* Make the SOAP WS marshaler use #columns to decide which fields to marshal as well, avoids providing attributes brought in by associations
  
* Add <tt>ActionWebService::API::Base.allow_active_record_expects</tt> option, with a default of false. Setting this to true will allow specifying ActiveRecord::Base model classes in <tt>:expects</tt>. API writers should take care to validate the received ActiveRecord model objects when turning it on, and/or have an authentication mechanism in place to reduce the security risk.

* Improve error message reporting. Bugs in either AWS or the web service itself will send back a protocol-specific error report message if possible, otherwise, provide as much detail as possible.

* Removed type checking of received parameters, and perform casting for XML-RPC if possible, but fallback to the received parameters if casting fails, closes #677

* Refactored SOAP and XML-RPC marshaling and encoding into a small library devoted exclusively to protocol specifics, also cleaned up the SOAP marshaling approach, so that array and custom type marshaling should be a bit faster.

* Add namespaced XML-RPC method name support, closes #678

* Replace '::' with '..' in fully qualified type names for marshaling and WSDL. This improves interoperability with .NET, and closes #676.


*0.5.0* (24th February, 2005)

	* lib/action_service/dispatcher*: replace "router" fragments with
	  one file for Action Controllers, moves dispatching work out of
	  the container
	* lib/*,test/*,examples/*: rename project to
	  ActionWebService. prefix all generic "service" type names with web_.
	  update all using code as well as the RDoc.
	* lib/action_service/router/wsdl.rb: ensure that #wsdl is
	  defined in the final container class, or the new ActionPack
	  filtering will exclude it
	* lib/action_service/struct.rb,test/struct_test.rb: create a
	  default #initialize on inherit that accepts a Hash containing
	  the default member values
	* lib/action_service/api/action_controller.rb: add support and
	  tests for #client_api in controller
	* test/router_wsdl_test.rb: add tests to ensure declared
	  service names don't contain ':', as ':' causes interoperability
	  issues
	* lib/*, test/*: rename "interface" concept to "api", and change all
	  related uses to reflect this change. update all uses of Inflector
	  to call the method on String instead.
	* test/api_test.rb: add test to ensure API definition not
	  instantiatable
	* lib/action_service/invocation.rb: change @invocation_params to
	  @method_params
	* lib/*: update RDoc
	* lib/action_service/struct.rb: update to support base types
	* lib/action_service/support/signature.rb: support the notion of
	  "base types" in signatures, with well-known unambiguous names such as :int,
	  :bool, etc, which map to the correct Ruby class. accept the same names
	  used by ActiveRecord as well as longer versions of each, as aliases.
	* examples/*: update for seperate API definition updates
	* lib/action_service/*, test/*: extensive refactoring: define API methods in
	  a seperate class, and specify it wherever used with 'service_api'.
	  this makes writing a client API for accessing defined API methods
	  with ActionWebService really easy.
	* lib/action_service/container.rb: fix a bug in default call
	  handling for direct dispatching, and add ActionController filter
	  support for direct dispatching.
	* test/router_action_controller_test.rb: add tests to ensure
	  ActionController filters are actually called.
	* test/protocol_soap_test.rb: add more tests for direct dispatching.

0.3.0

	* First public release
