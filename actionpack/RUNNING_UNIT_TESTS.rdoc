== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, check out the
full array of rake tasks with "rake -T".

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org.

== Running by hand

Run a single test suite:

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb

Run one test in a test suite:

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb TESTOPTS="--name=test_something"
