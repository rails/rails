module ActionController
  # # Action Controller Base
  #
  # Action Controllers are the core of a web request in Rails. They are made up of
  # one or more actions that are executed on request and then either it renders a
  # template or redirects to another action. An action is defined as a public
  # method on the controller, which will automatically be made accessible to the
  # web-server through Rails Routes.
  #
  # By default, only the ApplicationController in a Rails application inherits
  # from `ActionController::Base`. All other controllers inherit from
  # ApplicationController. This gives you one class to configure things such as
  # request forgery protection and filtering of sensitive request parameters.
  #
  # A sample controller could look like this:
  #
  #     class PostsController < ApplicationController
  #       def index
  #         @posts = Post.all
  #       end
  #
  #       def create
  #         @post = Post.create params[:post]
  #         redirect_to posts_path
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # Actions, by default, render a template in the `app/views` directory
  # corresponding to the name of the controller and action after executing code in
  # the action. For example, the `index` action of the PostsController would
  # render the template `app/views/posts/index.html.erb` by default after
  # populating the `@posts` instance variable.
  #
  # Unlike index, the create action will not render a template. After performing
  # its main purpose (creating a new post), it initiates a redirect instead. This
  # redirect works by returning an external `302 Moved` HTTP response that takes
  # the user to the index action.
  #
  # These two methods represent the two basic action archetypes used in Action
  # Controllers: Get-and-show and do-and-redirect. Most actions are variations on
  # these themes.
  #
  # ## Requests
  #
  # For every request, the router determines the value of the `controller` and
  # `action` keys. These determine which controller and action are called. The
  # remaining request parameters, the session (if one is available), and the full
  # request with all the HTTP headers are made available to the action through
  # accessor methods. Then the action is performed.
  #
  # The full request object is available via the request accessor and is primarily
  # used to query for HTTP headers:
  #
  #     def server_ip
  #       location = request.env["REMOTE_ADDR"]
  #       render plain: "This server hosted at #{location}"
  #     end
  #
  # ## Parameters
  #
  # All request parameters, whether they come from a query string in the URL or
  # form data submitted through a POST request are available through the `params`
  # method which returns a hash. For example, an action that was performed through
  # `/posts?category=All&limit=5` will include `{ "category" => "All", "limit" =>
  # "5" }` in `params`.
  #
  # It's also possible to construct multi-dimensional parameter hashes by
  # specifying keys using brackets, such as:
  #
  #     <input type="text" name="post[name]" value="david">
  #     <input type="text" name="post[address]" value="hyacintvej">
  #
  # A request coming from a form holding these inputs will include `{ "post" => {
  # "name" => "david", "address" => "hyacintvej" } }`. If the address input had
  # been named `post[address][street]`, the `params` would have included `{ "post"
  # => { "address" => { "street" => "hyacintvej" } } }`. There's no limit to the
  # depth of the nesting.
  #
  # ## Sessions
  #
  # Sessions allow you to store objects in between requests. This is useful for
  # objects that are not yet ready to be persisted, such as a Signup object
  # constructed in a multi-paged process, or objects that don't change much and
  # are needed all the time, such as a User object for a system that requires
  # login. The session should not be used, however, as a cache for objects where
  # it's likely they could be changed unknowingly. It's usually too much work to
  # keep it all synchronized -- something databases already excel at.
  #
  # You can place objects in the session by using the `session` method, which
  # accesses a hash:
  #
  #     session[:person] = Person.authenticate(user_name, password)
  #
  # You can retrieve it again through the same hash:
  #
  #     "Hello #{session[:person]}"
  #
  # For removing objects from the session, you can either assign a single key to
  # `nil`:
  #
  #     # removes :person from session
  #     session[:person] = nil
  #
  # or you can remove the entire session with `reset_session`.
  #
  # By default, sessions are stored in an encrypted browser cookie (see
  # ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore). Thus the user will not be able to read
  # or edit the session data. However, the user can keep a copy of the cookie even
  # after it has expired, so you should avoid storing sensitive information in
  # cookie-based sessions.
  #
  # ## Responses
  #
  # Each action results in a response, which holds the headers and document to be
  # sent to the user's browser. The actual response object is generated
  # automatically through the use of renders and redirects and requires no user
  # intervention.
  #
  # ## Renders
  #
  # Action Controller sends content to the user by using one of five rendering
  # methods. The most versatile and common is the rendering of a template.
  # Included in the Action Pack is the Action View, which enables rendering of ERB
  # templates. It's automatically configured. The controller passes objects to the
  # view by assigning instance variables:
  #
  #     def show
  #       @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  #     end
  #
  # Which are then automatically available to the view:
  #
  #     Title: <%= @post.title %>
  #
  # You don't have to rely on the automated rendering. For example, actions that
  # could result in the rendering of different templates will use the manual
  # rendering methods:
  #
  #     def search
  #       @results = Search.find(params[:query])
  #       case @results.count
  #         when 0 then render action: "no_results"
  #         when 1 then render action: "show"
  #         when 2..10 then render action: "show_many"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # Read more about writing ERB and Builder templates in ActionView::Base.
  #
  # ## Redirects
  #
  # Redirects are used to move from one action to another. For example, after a
  # `create` action, which stores a blog entry to the database, we might like to
  # show the user the new entry. Because we're following good DRY principles
  # (Don't Repeat Yourself), we're going to reuse (and redirect to) a `show`
  # action that we'll assume has already been created. The code might look like
  # this:
  #
  #     def create
  #       @entry = Entry.new(params[:entry])
  #       if @entry.save
  #         # The entry was saved correctly, redirect to show
  #         redirect_to action: 'show', id: @entry.id
  #       else
  #         # things didn't go so well, do something else
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # In this case, after saving our new entry to the database, the user is
  # redirected to the `show` method, which is then executed. Note that this is an
  # external HTTP-level redirection which will cause the browser to make a second
  # request (a GET to the show action), and not some internal re-routing which
  # calls both "create" and then "show" within one request.
  #
  # Learn more about `redirect_to` and what options you have in
  # ActionController::Redirecting.
  #
  # ## Calling multiple redirects or renders
  #
  # An action may perform only a single render or a single redirect. Attempting to
  # do either again will result in a DoubleRenderError:
  #
  #     def do_something
  #       redirect_to action: "elsewhere"
  #       render action: "overthere" # raises DoubleRenderError
  #     end
  #
  # If you need to redirect on the condition of something, then be sure to add
  # "return" to halt execution.
  #
  #     def do_something
  #       if monkeys.nil?
  #         redirect_to(action: "elsewhere")
  #         return
  #       end
  #       render action: "overthere" # won't be called if monkeys is nil
  #     end
