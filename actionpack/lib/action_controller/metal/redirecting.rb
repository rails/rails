    # Redirects the browser to the target specified in +options+. This parameter can be any one of:
    #
    # * <tt>Hash</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+.
    # * <tt>Record</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+, which will reference a named URL for that record.
    # * <tt>String</tt> starting with <tt>protocol://</tt> (like <tt>http://</tt>) or a protocol relative reference (like <tt>//</tt>) - Is passed straight through as the target for redirection.
    # * <tt>String</tt> not containing a protocol - The current protocol and host is prepended to the string.
    # * <tt>Proc</tt> - A block that will be executed in the controller's context. Should return any option accepted by +redirect_to+.

    # === Examples:
    #
    #   redirect_to action: "show", id: 5
    #   redirect_to post
    #   redirect_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org"
    #   redirect_to "/images/screenshot.jpg"
    #   redirect_to articles_url
    #   redirect_to proc { edit_post_url(@post) }
    #
    # The redirection happens as a "302 Found" header unless otherwise specified using the <tt>:status</tt> option:
    #
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), status: :found
    #   redirect_to action: 'atom', status: :moved_permanently
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), status: 301
    #   redirect_to action: 'atom', status: 302
    #
    # The status code can either be a standard {HTTP Status code}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes] as an
    # integer, or a symbol representing the downcased, underscored and symbolized description.
    # Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP code, or redirection will not occur.
    #
    # If you are using XHR requests other than GET or POST and redirecting after the
    # request then some browsers will follow the redirect using the original request
    # method. This may lead to undesirable behavior such as a double DELETE. To work
    # around this  you can return a <tt>303 See Other</tt> status code which will be
    # followed using a GET request.
    #
    #   redirect_to posts_url, status: :see_other
    #   redirect_to action: 'index', status: 303
    #
    # It is also possible to assign a flash message as part of the redirection. There are two special accessors for the commonly used flash names
    # +alert+ and +notice+ as well as a general purpose +flash+ bucket.
    #
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), alert: "Watch it, mister!"
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), status: :found, notice: "Pay attention to the road"
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), status: 301, flash: { updated_post_id: @post.id }
    #   redirect_to({ action: 'atom' }, alert: "Something serious happened")
    #
