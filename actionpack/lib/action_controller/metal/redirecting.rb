    # Redirects the browser to the target specified in +options+. This parameter can take one of three forms:
    #
    # * <tt>Hash</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+.
    # * <tt>Record</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+, which will reference a named URL for that record.
    # * <tt>String</tt> starting with <tt>protocol://</tt> (like <tt>http://</tt>) or a protocol relative reference (like <tt>//</tt>) - Is passed straight through as the target for redirection.
    # * <tt>String</tt> not containing a protocol - The current protocol and host is prepended to the string.
    # * <tt>Proc</tt> - A block that will be executed in the controller's context. Should return any option accepted by +redirect_to+.
    # * <tt>:back</tt> - Back to the page that issued the request. Useful for forms that are triggered from multiple places.
    #   Short-hand for <tt>redirect_to(request.env["HTTP_REFERER"])</tt>
    #
    # Examples:
    #   redirect_to :action => "show", :id => 5
    #   redirect_to post
    #   redirect_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org"
    #   redirect_to "/images/screenshot.jpg"
    #   redirect_to articles_url
    #   redirect_to :back
    #   redirect_to proc { edit_post_url(@post) }
    #
    # The redirection happens as a "302 Moved" header unless otherwise specified.
    #
    # Examples:
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), :status => :found
    #   redirect_to :action=>'atom', :status => :moved_permanently
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), :status => 301
    #   redirect_to :action=>'atom', :status => 302
    #
    # The status code can either be a standard {HTTP Status code}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes] as an
    # integer, or a symbol representing the downcased, underscored and symbolized description.
    # Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP code, or redirection will not occur.
    #
    # It is also possible to assign a flash message as part of the redirection. There are two special accessors for the commonly used flash names
    # +alert+ and +notice+ as well as a general purpose +flash+ bucket.
    #
    # Examples:
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), :alert => "Watch it, mister!"
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), :status=> :found, :notice => "Pay attention to the road"
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), :status => 301, :flash => { :updated_post_id => @post.id }
    #   redirect_to { :action=>'atom' }, :alert => "Something serious happened"
    #
    # When using <tt>redirect_to :back</tt>, if there is no referrer, ActionController::RedirectBackError will be raised. You may specify some fallback
    # behavior for this case by rescuing ActionController::RedirectBackError.
