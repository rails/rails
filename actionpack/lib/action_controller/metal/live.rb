module ActionController
  # # Action Controller Live
  #
  # Mix this module into your controller, and all actions in that controller will
  # be able to stream data to the client as it's written.
  #
  #     class MyController < ActionController::Base
  #       include ActionController::Live
  #
  #       def stream
  #         response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'
  #         100.times {
  #           response.stream.write "hello world\n"
  #           sleep 1
  #         }
  #       ensure
  #         response.stream.close
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # There are a few caveats with this module. You **cannot** write headers after
  # the response has been committed (Response#committed? will return truthy).
  # Calling `write` or `close` on the response stream will cause the response
  # object to be committed. Make sure all headers are set before calling write or
  # close on your stream.
  #
  # You **must** call close on your stream when you're finished, otherwise the
  # socket may be left open forever.
  #
  # The final caveat is that your actions are executed in a separate thread than
  # the main thread. Make sure your actions are thread safe, and this shouldn't be
  # a problem (don't share state across threads, etc).
  #
  # Note that Rails includes `Rack::ETag` by default, which will buffer your
  # response. As a result, streaming responses may not work properly with Rack
  # 2.2.x, and you may need to implement workarounds in your application. You can
  # either set the `ETag` or `Last-Modified` response headers or remove
  # `Rack::ETag` from the middleware stack to address this issue.
  #
  # Here's an example of how you can set the `Last-Modified` header if your Rack
  # version is 2.2.x:
  #
  #     def stream
  #       response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/event-stream"
  #       response.headers["Last-Modified"] = Time.now.httpdate # Add this line if your Rack version is 2.2.x
  #       ...
  #     end

    # # Action Controller Live Server Sent Events
    #
    # This class provides the ability to write an SSE (Server Sent Event) to an IO
    # stream. The class is initialized with a stream and can be used to either write
    # a JSON string or an object which can be converted to JSON.
    #
    # Writing an object will convert it into standard SSE format with whatever
    # options you have configured. You may choose to set the following options:
    #
    # `:event`
    # :   If specified, an event with this name will be dispatched on the browser.
    #
    # `:retry`
    # :   The reconnection time in milliseconds used when attempting to send the event.
    #
    # `:id`
    # :   If the connection dies while sending an SSE to the browser, then the
    #     server will receive a `Last-Event-ID` header with value equal to `id`.
    #
    # After setting an option in the constructor of the SSE object, all future SSEs
    # sent across the stream will use those options unless overridden.
    #
    # Example Usage:
    #
    #     class MyController < ActionController::Base
    #       include ActionController::Live
    #
    #       def index
    #         response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'
    #         sse = SSE.new(response.stream, retry: 300, event: "event-name")
    #         sse.write({ name: 'John'})
    #         sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10)
    #         sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10, event: "other-event")
    #         sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10, event: "other-event", retry: 500)
    #       ensure
    #         sse.close
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Note: SSEs are not currently supported by IE. However, they are supported by
    # Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.

    # Sends a stream to the browser, which is helpful when you're generating exports
    # or other running data where you don't want the entire file buffered in memory
    # first. Similar to send_data, but where the data is generated live.
    #
    # Options:
    # *   `:filename` - suggests a filename for the browser to use.
    # *   `:type` - specifies an HTTP content type. You can specify either a string
    #     or a symbol for a registered type with `Mime::Type.register`, for example
    #     :json. If omitted, type will be inferred from the file extension specified
    #     in `:filename`. If no content type is registered for the extension, the
    #     default type 'application/octet-stream' will be used.
    # *   `:disposition` - specifies whether the file will be shown inline or
    #     downloaded. Valid values are 'inline' and 'attachment' (default).
