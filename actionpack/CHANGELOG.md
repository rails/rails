## Rails 4.0.5 (May 6, 2014) ##

*   Only accept actions without File::SEPARATOR in the name.

    This will avoid directory traversal in implicit render.

    Fixes: CVE-2014-0130

    *Rafael Mendonça França*


## Rails 4.0.4 (March 14, 2014) ##

*   Fix label translation for more than 10 nested elements.

    *Vladimir Krylov*

*   Use a custom route visitor for optimized url generation. Fixes #13349.

    *Andrew White*

*   Set the `:shallow_path` scope option as each scope is generated rather than
    waiting until the `shallow` option is set. Also make the behavior of the
    `:shallow` resource option consistent with the behavior of the `shallow` method.

    Fixes #12498.

    *Andrew White*, *Aleksi Aalto*

*   Do not discard query parameters that form a hash with the same root key as
    the `wrapper_key` for a request using `wrap_parameters`.

    *Josh Jordan*

*   Ensure that `request.filtered_parameters` is reset between calls to `process`
    in `ActionController::TestCase`.

    Fixes #13803.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix `rake routes` error when `Rails::Engine` with empty routes is mounted.

    Fixes #13810.

    *Maurizio De Santis*

*   Unique the segment keys array for non-optimized url helpers

    In Rails 3.2 you only needed pass an argument for dynamic segment once so
    unique the segment keys array to match the number of args. Since the number
    of args is less than required parts the non-optimized code path is selected.
    This means to benefit from optimized url generation the arg needs to be
    specified as many times as it appears in the path.

    Fixes #12808.

    *Andrew White*

*   Show full route constraints in error message

    When an optimized helper fails to generate, show the full route constraints
    in the error message. Previously it would only show the contraints that were
    required as part of the path.

    Fixes #13592.

    *Andrew White*

*   Allow engine root relative redirects using an empty string.

    Example:

        # application routes.rb
        mount BlogEngine => '/blog'

        # engine routes.rb
        get '/welcome' => redirect('')

    This now redirects to the path `/blog`, whereas before it would redirect
    to the application root path. In the case of a path redirect or a custom
    redirect if the path returned contains a host then the path is treated as
    absolute. Similarly for option redirects, if the options hash returned
    contains a `:host` or `:domain` key then the path is treated as absolute.

    Fixes #7977.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix `Encoding::CompatibilityError` when public path is UTF-8

    In #5337 we forced the path encoding to ASCII-8BIT to prevent static file handling
    from blowing up before an application has had chance to deal with possibly invalid
    urls. However this has a negative side effect of making it an incompatible encoding
    if the application's public path has UTF-8 characters in it.

    To work around the problem we check to see if the path has a valid encoding once
    it has been unescaped. If it is not valid then we can return early since it will
    not match any file anyway.

    Fixes #13518.

    *Andrew White*

*   `ActionController::Parameters#permit!` permits hashes in array values.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Converts hashes in arrays of unfiltered params to unpermitted params.

    Fixes #13382.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   `rake routes` shows routes defined under assets prefix.

    *Ryunosuke SATO*

*   Label tags generated by collection helpers only inherit the `:index` and
    `:namespace` from the input, because only these attributes modifies the
    `for` attribute of the label. Also, the input attributes don't have
    precedence over the label attributes anymore.

    Before:

        collection = [[1, true, { class: 'foo' }]]
        f.collection_check_boxes :options, collection, :second, :first do |b|
          b.label(class: 'my_custom_class')
        end

        # => <label class="foo" for="user_active_true">1</label>

    After:

        collection = [[1, true, { class: 'foo' }]]
        f.collection_check_boxes :options, collection, :second, :first do |b|
          b.label(class: 'my_custom_class')
        end

        # => <label class="my_custom_class" for="user_active_true">1</label>

    *Andriel Nuernberg*

*   Fix regression when using `ActionView::Helpers::TranslationHelper#translate` with
    `options[:raise]`.

    This regression was introduced at ec16ba75a5493b9da972eea08bae630eba35b62f.

    *Shota Fukumori (sora_h)*

*   Fix render of localized templates without an explicit format using wrong
    content header and not passing correct formats to template due to the
    introduction of the `NullType` for mimes.

    Templates like `hello.it.erb` were subject to this issue.

    Fixes #13064.

    *Angelo Capilleri*, *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   Fix regression with `simple_format` not having access to the `raw` method
    when included in isolation, introduced with the security fix in Rails 4.0.2.

    *Mario Visic*

*   Fix formatting for `rake routes` when a section is shorter than a header.

    *Sıtkı Bağdat*

*   Use `set_backtrace` instead of instance variable `@backtrace` in ActionView exceptions.

    *Shimpei Makimoto*

*   Fix `simple_format` escapes own output when passing `sanitize: true`.

    *Paul Seidemann*

*   Don't let strong parameters mutate the given hash via `fetch`.

    Create a new instance if the given parameter is a `Hash` instead of
    passing it to the `convert_hashes_to_parameters` method since it is
    overriding its default value.

    *Brendon Murphy*, *Doug Cole*


## Rails 4.0.3 (February 18, 2014) ##

*   Escape format, negative_format and units options of number helpers

    Fixes: CVE-2014-0081


## Rails 4.0.2 (December 02, 2013) ##

*   Ensure simple_format escapes its html attributes. This fixes CVE-2013-6416

*   Deep Munge the parameters for GET and POST Fixes CVE-2013-6417

*   Stop using i18n's built in HTML error handling.  Fixes: CVE-2013-4491

*   Escape the unit value provided to number_to_currency Fixes CVE-2013-6415

*   Only use valid mime type symbols as cache keys CVE-2013-6414


## Rails 4.0.1 (November 01, 2013) ##

*   Respect `SCRIPT_NAME` when using `redirect` with a relative path

    Example:
        # application routes.rb
        mount BlogEngine => '/blog'

        # engine routes.rb
        get '/admin' => redirect('admin/dashboard')

    This now redirects to the path `/blog/admin/dashboard`, whereas before it would've
    generated an invalid url because there would be no slash between the host name and
    the path. It also allows redirects to work where the application is deployed to a
    subdirectory of a website.

    Fixes #7977.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix `ActionDispatch::RemoteIp::GetIp#calculate_ip` to only check for spoofing
    attacks if both `HTTP_CLIENT_IP` and `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` are set.

    Fixes #10844.

    *Tamir Duberstein*

*   Strong parameters should permit nested number as key.

    Fixes #12293.

    *kennyj*

*   Fix `collection_check_boxes` generated hidden input to use the name attribute provided
    in the options hash.

    *Angel N. Sciortino*

*   Fix some edge cases for AV `select` helper with `:selected` option

    *Bogdan Gusiev*

*   Handle `:namespace` form option in collection labels

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Fix an issue where router can't recognize downcased url encoding path.

    Fixes #12269.

    *kennyj*

*   Fix custom flash type definition. Misusage of the `_flash_types` class variable
    caused an error when reloading controllers with custom flash types.

    Fixes #12057.

    *Ricardo de Cillo*

*   Do not break params filtering on `nil` values.

    Fixes #12149.

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Fix `excerpt` when `:separator` is `nil`.

    *Paul Nikitochkin*

*   Make Live Streaming work with basic authentication or builder.

    Fixes #10984.

    *Aaron Patterson*

*   Always use `Rack::Sendfile` to make possible to it be automatically
    configured by the webserver.

    Fixes #11440.

    *Martin Schürrer*

*   Flag cookies as secure with ignore case in `ActionDispatch::SSL`.

    *Yamagishi Kazutoshi*

*   Don't include STS header in non-HTTPS responses.

    *Geoff Buesing*

*   Fix an issue where rails raise exception about missing helper where it
    should throw `LoadError`. When helper file exists and only loaded file from
    this helper does not exist rails should throw LoadError instead of
    `MissingHelperError`.

    *Piotr Niełacny*

*   Only cache template digests if `config.cache_template_loading` is true.

    *Josh Lauer*, *Justin Ridgewell*

*   Fix an issue where `:if` and `:unless` controller action procs were being run
    before checking for the correct action in the `:only` and `:unless` options.

    Fixes #11799.

    *Nicholas Jakobsen*

*   Fix an issue where `assert_dom_equal` and `assert_dom_not_equal` were
    ignoring the passed failure message argument.

    Fixes #11751.

    *Ryan McGeary*

*   Fix `current_page?` when the URL contains escaped characters and the
    original URL is using the hexadecimal lowercased.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Allow `REMOTE_ADDR`, `HTTP_HOST` and `HTTP_USER_AGENT` to be overridden from
    the environment passed into `ActionDispatch::TestRequest.new`.

    Fixes #11590.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix `text_area` to behave like `text_field` when `nil` is given as
    value.

    Before:

        f.text_field :field, value: nil #=> <input value="">
        f.text_area :field, value: nil  #=> <textarea>value of field</textarea>

    After:

        f.text_area :field, value: nil  #=> <textarea></textarea>

    *Joel Cogen*

*   Fix an issue where Journey was failing to clear the named routes hash when the
    routes were reloaded and since it doesn't overwrite existing routes then if a
    route changed but wasn't renamed it kept the old definition. This was being
    masked by the optimised url helpers so it only became apparent when passing an
    options hash to the url helper.

    *Andrew White*

*   Skip routes pointing to a redirect or mounted application when generating urls
    using an options hash as they aren't relevant and generate incorrect urls.

    Fixes #8018.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix default rendered format problem when calling `render` without `:content_type` option.
    It should return `:html`.

    Fixes #11393.

    *Gleb Mazovetskiy*, *Oleg*, *kennyj*

*   Fix `ActionDispatch::ParamsParser#parse_formatted_parameters` to rewind body input stream on
    parsing json params.

    Fixes #11345.

    *Yuri Bol*, *Paul Nikitochkin*

*   Fix `link_to` with block and url hashes.

    Before:

        link_to(action: 'bar', controller: 'foo') { content_tag(:span, 'Example site') }
        # => "<a action=\"bar\" controller=\"foo\"><span>Example site</span></a>"

    After:

        link_to(action: 'bar', controller: 'foo') { content_tag(:span, 'Example site') }
        # => "<a href=\"/foo/bar\"><span>Example site</span></a>"

    *Murahashi Sanemat Kenichi*

*   Fix "Stack Level Too Deep" error when redering recursive partials.

    Fixes #11340.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Pick `DateField` `DateTimeField` and `ColorField` values from stringified options allowing use of symbol keys with helpers.

    *Jon Rowe*

*   Fix `Mime::Type.parse` when bad accepts header is looked up. Previously it
    was setting `request.formats` with an array containing a `nil` value, which
    raised an error when setting the controller formats.

    Fixes #10965.

    *Becker*

*   Always escape the result of `link_to_unless` method.

    Before:

        link_to_unless(true, '<b>Showing</b>', 'github.com')
        # => "<b>Showing</b>"

    After:

        link_to_unless(true, '<b>Showing</b>', 'github.com')
        # => "&lt;b&gt;Showing&lt;/b&gt;"

## Rails 4.0.0 (June 25, 2013) ##

*   Merge `:action` from routing scope and assign endpoint if both `:controller`
    and `:action` are present. The endpoint assignment only occurs if there is
    no `:to` present in the options hash so should only affect routes using the
    shorthand syntax (i.e. endpoint is inferred from the the path).

    Fixes #9856

    *Yves Senn*, *Andrew White*

*   Use a case insensitive URI Regexp for #asset_path.

    This fix a problem where the same asset path using different case are generating
    different URIs.

    Before:

        image_tag("HTTP://google.com")
        # => "<img alt=\"Google\" src=\"/assets/HTTP://google.com\" />"
        image_tag("http://google.com")
        # => "<img alt=\"Google\" src=\"http://google.com\" />"

    After:

        image_tag("HTTP://google.com")
        # => "<img alt=\"Google\" src=\"HTTP://google.com\" />"
        image_tag("http://google.com")
        # => "<img alt=\"Google\" src=\"http://google.com\" />"

    *David Celis*

*   Add `has_named_route?(route_name)` to the mapper API.

    *José Valim*

*   Fix an issue where partials with a number in the filename weren't being digested for cache dependencies.

    *Bryan Ricker*

*   Add support for passing custom url options other than `:host` and custom
    status and flash options to `force_ssl`.

    *Andrew White*

*   The `force_ssl` command now builds the redirect url from `request.fullpath`.
    This ensures that the format is maintained and it doesn't redirect to a route
    that has the same parameters but is defined earlier in `routes.rb`. Also any
    optional segments are maintained.

    Fixes #7528, #9061, #10305.

    *Andrew White*

*   Return a 405 Method Not Allowed response when a request contains an unknown
    HTTP method.

    *Lewis Marshall*

*   Add support for extracting the port from the `:host` option passed to `url_for`.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add support for removing the subdomain from a url by passing `nil`, `false` or `''`.
    Fixes #10180.

    *Derek Watson + Andrew White*

*   Element of the collection for `options_from_collection_for_select` helper can
    optionally contain html attributes as the last element of the array as
    `options_for_select` helper.

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Fix explicit names on multiple file fields. If a file field tag has
    the multiple option, it is turned into an array field (appending `[]`),
    but if an explicit name is passed to `file_field` the `[]` is not
    appended.
    Fixes #9830.

    *Ryan McGeary*

*   Add block support for the `mail_to` helper, similar to the `link_to` helper.

    *Sam Pohlenz*

*   Automatically configure cookie-based sessions to be encrypted if
    `secret_key_base` is set, falling back to signed if only `secret_token`
    is set. Automatically upgrade existing signed cookie-based sessions from
    Rails 3.x to be encrypted if both `secret_key_base` and `secret_token`
    are set, or signed with the new key generator if only `secret_token` is
    set. This leaves only the `config.session_store :cookie_store` option and
    removes the two new options introduced in 4.0.0.beta1:
    `encrypted_cookie_store` and `upgrade_signature_to_encryption_cookie_store`.

    *Trevor Turk*

*   Ensure consistent fallback to the default layout lookup for layouts set
    using symbols or procs that return `nil`.

    All of the following layouts will result in the default layout lookup:

        layout nil

        layout proc { nil }

        layout :returns_nil
        def returns_nil
          nil
        end

    Previously symbols and procs which returned `nil` resulted in no layout which
    differed from the `layout nil` behavior. To get the "no layout" behavior just
    return `false` instead of `nil` for `layout`.

    *Chris Nicola*

*   Create `UpgradeLegacySignedCookieJar` to transparently upgrade existing signed
    cookies generated by Rails 3.x to avoid invalidating them when upgrading to Rails 4.x.

    *Trevor Turk + Neeraj Singh*

*   Raise an `ArgumentError` when a clashing named route is defined.

    *Trevor Turk*

*   Allow default url options to accept host with protocol such as `http://`

        config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "http://mydomain.com" }

    *Richard Schneeman*

*   Ensure that digest authentication responds with a 401 status when a basic
    header is received.

    *Brad Dunbar*

*   Include I18n locale fallbacks in view lookup.
    Fixes #3512.

    *Juan Barreneche*

*   Integration and functional tests allow headers and rack env
    variables to be passed when performing requests.
    Fixes #6513.

    Example:

        # integration test
        get "/success", {}, "HTTP_REFERER" => "http://test.com/",
                            "Accepts" => "text/plain, text/html"

        # functional test
        @request.headers["Accepts"] = "text/plain, text/html"

    *Yves Senn*

*   Http::Headers respects headers that are not prefixed with HTTP_

    *Yves Senn*

*   Fix incorrectly appended square brackets to a multiple select box
    if an explicit name has been given and it already ends with "[]"

    Before:

        select(:category, [], {}, multiple: true, name: "post[category][]")
        # => <select name="post[category][][]" ...>

    After:

        select(:category, [], {}, multiple: true, name: "post[category][]")
        # => <select name="post[category][]" ...>

    *Olek Janiszewski*

*   Fixed regression when using `assert_template` to verify files sent using
    `render file: 'README.md'`.
    Fixes #9464.

    *Justin Coyne*

*   Fixed `ActionView::Helpers::CaptureHelper#content_for` regression when trying to use it in
    a boolean statement.
    Fixes #9360.

    *Nikolay Shebanov*

*   `format: true` does not override existing format constraints.
    Fixes #9466.

    Example:

        # This will force the .json extension.
        get '/json_only', to: ok, format: true, constraints: { format: /json/ }

    *Yves Senn*

*   Skip valid encoding checks for non-String parameters that come
    from the matched route's defaults.
    Fixes #9435.

    Example:

        root to: 'main#posts', page: 1

    *Yves Senn*

*   Don't verify Regexp requirements for non-Regexp `:constraints`.
    Fixes #9432.

    Example:

        get '/photos.:format' => 'feeds#photos', constraints: {format: 'xml'}

    *Yves Senn*

*   Make `ActionDispatch::Journey::Path::Pattern#new` raise more meaningful exception message.

    *Thierry Zires*

*   Fix `respond_to` not using formats that have no block if all is present. *Michael Grosser*

*   New applications use an encrypted session store by default.

    *Santiago Pastorino*

*   Determine the controller#action from only the matched path when using the
    shorthand syntax. Previously the complete path was used, which led
    to problems with nesting (scopes and namespaces).
    Fixes #7554.

    Example:

        # This will route to questions#new.
        scope ':locale' do
          get 'questions/new'
        end

    *Yves Senn*

*   Remove support for parsing XML parameters from request. If you still want to parse XML
    parameters, please install `actionpack-xml_parser' gem.

    *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Remove support for parsing YAML parameters from request.

    *Aaron Patterson*

*   Add a message when you have no routes defined to both `rake routes` and
    GET "/rails/info/routes" that lets you know you have none defined and links
    to the Rails guide on the topic.

    *Steve Klabnik*

*   Change `image_alt` method to replace underscores/hyphens to spaces in filenames.

    Previously, underscored filenames became `alt="A_long_file_name_with_underscores"`
    in HTML, which is poor for accessibility. For instance, Apple's VoiceOver Utility
    pronounces each underscore. `A_long_file_name` thus would be read as `A underscore
    long underscore file underscore name.` Now underscored or hyphenated filenames
    (both of which are very popular naming conventions) read more naturally in
    screen readers by converting both hyphens and underscores to spaces.

    Before:

        image_tag('underscored_file_name.png')
        # => <img alt="Underscored_file_name" src="/assets/underscored_file_name.png" />

    After:

        image_tag('underscored_file_name.png')
        # => <img alt="Underscored file name" src="/assets/underscored_file_name.png" />

    *Nick Cox*

*   We don't support Ruby constant notation in the `:controller` option for route
    definitions. So, this raises an `ArgumentError` now:

        resources :posts, controller: "Admin::Posts" # WRONG

    Use path notation instead:

        resources :posts, controller: "admin/posts" # RIGHT

    *Yves Senn*

*   `assert_template` can be used to verify the locals of partials,
    which live inside a directory.

        # Prefixed partials inside directories worked and still work.
        assert_template partial: 'directory/_partial', locals: {name: 'John'}

        # This did not work but does now.
        assert_template partial: 'directory/partial', locals: {name: 'John'}

    Fixes #8516.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Fix `content_tag_for` with array HTML option.
    It would embed array as string instead of joining it like `content_tag` does:

        content_tag(:td, class: ["foo", "bar"]){}
        # => <td class="foo bar"></td>

    Before:

        content_tag_for(:td, item, class: ["foo", "bar"])
        # => <td class="item [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]" id="item_1"></td>

    After:

        content_tag_for(:td, item, class: ["foo", "bar"])
        # => <td class="item foo bar" id="item_1"></td>

    *Semyon Perepelitsa*

*   Remove `BestStandardsSupport` middleware, !DOCTYPE html already triggers
    standards mode per http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj676915(v=vs.85).aspx
    and ChromeFrame header has been moved to `config.action_dispatch.default_headers`

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Fix CSRF protection and `current_url?` helper to work with HEAD requests
    now that `ActionDispatch::Head` has been removed in favor of `Rack::Head`.

    *Michiel Sikkes*

*   Change `asset_path` to not include `SCRIPT_NAME` when it's used
    from a mounted engine. Fixes #8119.

    *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Add JavaScript based routing path matcher to `/rails/info/routes`.
    Routes can now be filtered by whether or not they match a path.

    *Richard Schneeman*

*   Change the behavior of route defaults so that explicit defaults are no longer
    required where the key is not part of the path. For example:

        resources :posts, bucket_type: 'posts'

    will be required whenever constructing the url from a hash such as a functional
    test or using `url_for` directly. However using the explicit form alters the
    behavior so it's not required:

        resources :projects, defaults: { bucket_type: 'projects' }

    This changes existing behavior slightly in that any routes which only differ
    in their defaults will match the first route rather than the closest match.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add support for routing constraints other than Regexp and String.
    For example this now allows the use of arrays like this:

        get '/foo/:action', to: 'foo', constraints: { subdomain: %w[www admin] }

    or constraints where the request method returns an Fixnum like this:

        get '/foo', to: 'foo#index', constraints: { port: 8080 }

    Note that this only applies to constraints on the request - path constraints
    still need to be specified as Regexps as the various constraints are compiled
    into a single Regexp.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix a bug in integration tests where setting the port via a url passed to
    the process method was ignored when constructing the request environment.

    *Andrew White*

*   Allow `:selected` to be set on `date_select` tag helper.

    *Colin Burn-Murdoch*

*   Fixed JSON params parsing regression for non-object JSON content.

    *Dylan Smith*

*   Extract `ActionDispatch::PerformanceTest` into https://github.com/rails/rails-perftest
    You can add the gem to your Gemfile to keep using performance tests.

        gem 'rails-perftest'

    *Yves Senn*

*   Added view_cache_dependency API for declaring dependencies that affect
    cache digest computation.

    *Jamis Buck*

*   `image_submit_tag` will set `alt` attribute from image source if not
    specified.

    *Nihad Abbasov*

*   Do not generate local variables for partials without object or collection.
    Previously rendering a partial without giving `:object` or `:collection`
    would generate a local variable with the partial name by default.

    *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   Return the last valid, non-private IP address from the X-Forwarded-For,
    Client-IP and Remote-Addr headers, in that order. Document the rationale
    for that decision, and describe the options that can be passed to the
    RemoteIp middleware to change it.
    Fixes #7979.

    *André Arko*, *Steve Klabnik*, *Alexey Gaziev*

*   Do not append second slash to `root_url` when using `trailing_slash: true`
    Fixes #8700.

    Before:

        root_url(trailing_slash: true) # => http://test.host//

    After:

        root_url(trailing_slash: true) # => http://test.host/

    *Yves Senn*

*   Allow to toggle dumps on error pages.

    *Gosha Arinich*

*   Fix a bug in `content_tag_for` that prevents it from working without a block.

    *Jasl*

*   Change the stylesheet of exception pages for development mode.
    Additionally display also the line of code and fragment that raised
    the exception in all exceptions pages.

    *Guillermo Iguaran + Jorge Cuadrado*

*   Do not append `charset=` parameter when `head` is called with a
    `:content_type` option.
    Fixes #8661.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Added `Mime::NullType` class. This  allows to use `html?`, `xml?`, `json?`, etc.
    when the format of the request is unknown, without raising an exception.

    *Angelo Capilleri*

*   Integrate the Journey gem into Action Dispatch so that the global namespace
    is not polluted with names that may be used as models.

    *Andrew White*

*   Extract support for email address obfuscation via `:encode`, `:replace_at`, and `replace_dot`
    options from the `mail_to` helper into the `actionview-encoded_mail_to` gem.

    *Nick Reed + DHH*

*   Handle `:protocol` option in `stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag`

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Clear url helper methods when routes are reloaded. *Andrew White*

*   Fix a bug in `ActionDispatch::Request#raw_post` that caused `env['rack.input']`
    to be read but not rewound.

    *Matt Venables*

*   Prevent raising `EOFError` on multipart GET request (IE issue). *Adam Stankiewicz*

*   Rename all action callbacks from *_filter to *_action to avoid the misconception that these
    callbacks are only suited for transforming or halting the response. With the new style,
    it's more inviting to use them as they were intended, like setting shared ivars for views.

    Example:

        class PeopleController < ActionController::Base
          before_action :set_person,      except: [:index, :new, :create]
          before_action :ensure_permission, only: [:edit, :update]

          ...

          private
            def set_person
              @person = current_account.people.find(params[:id])
            end

            def ensure_permission
              current_person.can_change?(@person)
            end
        end

    The old *_filter methods still work with no deprecation notice.

    *DHH*

*   Add `cache_if` and `cache_unless` for conditional fragment caching:

    Example:

        <%= cache_if condition, project do %>
          <b>All the topics on this project</b>
          <%= render project.topics %>
        <% end %>

        # and

        <%= cache_unless condition, project do %>
          <b>All the topics on this project</b>
          <%= render project.topics %>
        <% end %>

    *Stephen Ausman + Fabrizio Regini + Angelo Capilleri*

*   Add logging filter capability for redirect URLs:

        config.filter_redirect << 'http://please.hide.it/'

    *Fabrizio Regini*

*   Fixed a bug that ignores constraints on a glob route. This was caused because the constraint
    regular expression is overwritten when the `routes.rb` file is processed. Fixes #7924

    *Maura Fitzgerald*

*   More descriptive error messages when calling `render :partial` with
    an invalid `:layout` argument.

    Fixes #8376.

        render partial: 'partial', layout: true

        # results in ActionView::MissingTemplate: Missing partial /true

    *Yves Senn*

*   Sweepers was extracted from Action Controller as `rails-observers` gem.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add option flag to `CacheHelper#cache` to manually bypass automatic template digests:

        <% cache project, skip_digest: true do %>
          ...
        <% end %>

    *Drew Ulmer*

*   Do not sort Hash options in `grouped_options_for_select`. *Sergey Kojin*

*   Accept symbols as `send_data :disposition` value *Elia Schito*

*   Add i18n scope to `distance_of_time_in_words`. *Steve Klabnik*

*   `assert_template`:
    - is no more passing with empty string.
    - is now validating option keys. It accepts: `:layout`, `:partial`, `:locals` and `:count`.

    *Roberto Soares*

*   Allow setting a symbol as path in scope on routes. This is now allowed:

        scope :api do
          resources :users
        end

    It is also possible to pass multiple symbols to scope to shorten multiple nested scopes:

        scope :api do
          scope :v1 do
            resources :users
          end
        end

    can be rewritten as:

        scope :api, :v1 do
          resources :users
        end

    *Guillermo Iguaran + Amparo Luna*

*   Fix error when using a non-hash query argument named "params" in `url_for`.

    Before:

        url_for(params: "") # => undefined method `reject!' for "":String

    After:

        url_for(params: "") # => http://www.example.com?params=

    *tumayun + Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   Render every partial with a new `ActionView::PartialRenderer`. This resolves
    issues when rendering nested partials.
    Fixes #8197.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Introduce `ActionView::Template::Handlers::ERB.escape_whitelist`. This is a list
    of mime types where template text is not html escaped by default. It prevents `Jack & Joe`
    from rendering as `Jack &amp; Joe` for the whitelisted mime types. The default whitelist
    contains `text/plain`.
    Fixes #7976.

    *Joost Baaij*

*   Fix input name when `multiple: true` and `:index` are set.

    Before:

        check_box("post", "comment_ids", { multiple: true, index: "foo" }, 1)
        # => <input name=\"post[foo][comment_ids]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0\" /><input id=\"post_foo_comment_ids_1\" name=\"post[foo][comment_ids]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" />

    After:

        check_box("post", "comment_ids", { multiple: true, index: "foo" }, 1)
        # => <input name=\"post[foo][comment_ids][]\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0\" /><input id=\"post_foo_comment_ids_1\" name=\"post[foo][comment_ids][]\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" />

    Fixes #8108.

    *Daniel Fox, Grant Hutchins & Trace Wax*

*   `date_select` helper accepts `with_css_classes: true` to add css classes similar with type
    of generated select tags.

    *Pavel Nikitin*

*   Only non-js/css under `app/assets` path will be included in default `config.assets.precompile`.

    *Josh Peek*

*   Remove support for the `RAILS_ASSET_ID` environment configuration
    (no longer needed now that we have the asset pipeline).

    *Josh Peek*

*   Remove old `asset_path` configuration (no longer needed now that we have the asset pipeline).

    *Josh Peek*

*   `assert_template` can be used to assert on the same template with different locals
    Fixes #3675.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Remove old asset tag concatenation (no longer needed now that we have the asset pipeline).

    *Josh Peek*

*   Accept `:remote` as symbolic option for `link_to` helper. *Riley Lynch*

*   Warn when the `:locals` option is passed to `assert_template` outside of a view test case
    Fixes #3415.

    *Yves Senn*

*   The `Rack::Cache` middleware is now disabled by default. To enable it,
    set `config.action_dispatch.rack_cache = true` and add `gem rack-cache` to your Gemfile.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   `ActionController::Base.page_cache_extension` option is deprecated
    in favour of `ActionController::Base.default_static_extension`.

    *Francesco Rodriguez*

*   Action and Page caching has been extracted from Action Dispatch
    as `actionpack-action_caching` and `actionpack-page_caching` gems.
    Please read the `README.md` file on both gems for the usage.

    *Francesco Rodriguez*

*   Failsafe exception returns `text/plain`. *Steve Klabnik*

*   Rename internal variables on `ActionController::TemplateAssertions` to prevent
    naming collisions. `@partials`, `@templates` and `@layouts` are now prefixed with an underscore.
    Fixes #7459.

    *Yves Senn*

*   `resource` and `resources` don't modify the passed options hash.
    Fixes #7777.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Precompiled assets include aliases from `foo.js` to `foo/index.js` and vice versa.

        # Precompiles phone-<digest>.css and aliases phone/index.css to phone.css.
        config.assets.precompile = [ 'phone.css' ]

        # Precompiles phone/index-<digest>.css and aliases phone.css to phone/index.css.
        config.assets.precompile = [ 'phone/index.css' ]

        # Both of these work with either precompile thanks to their aliases.
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'phone', media: 'all' %>
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'phone/index', media: 'all' %>

    *Jeremy Kemper*

*   `assert_template` is no more passing with what ever string that matches
    with the template name.

    Before when we have a template `/layout/hello.html.erb`, `assert_template`
    was passing with any string that matches. This behavior allowed false
    positive like:

        assert_template "layout"
        assert_template "out/hello"

    Now it only passes with:

        assert_template "layout/hello"
        assert_template "hello"

    Fixes #3849.

    *Hugolnx*

*   `image_tag` will set the same width and height for image if numerical value
    passed to `size` option.

    *Nihad Abbasov*

*   Deprecate `Mime::Type#verify_request?` and `Mime::Type.browser_generated_types`,
    since they are no longer used inside of Rails, they will be removed in Rails 4.1.

    *Michael Grosser*

*   `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` now delegates `close` to its tempfile. *Sergio Gil*

*   Add `ActionController::StrongParameters`, this module converts `params` hash into
    an instance of ActionController::Parameters that allows whitelisting of permitted
    parameters. Non-permitted parameters are forbidden to be used in Active Model by default
    For more details check the documentation of the module or the
    [strong_parameters gem](https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters)

    *DHH + Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Remove Integration between `attr_accessible`/`attr_protected` and
    `ActionController::ParamsWrapper`. ParamWrapper now wraps all the parameters returned
    by the class method `attribute_names`.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Log now displays the correct status code when an exception is raised.
    Fixes #7646.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Allow pass couple extensions to `ActionView::Template.register_template_handler` call.

    *Tima Maslyuchenko*

*   Sprockets integration has been extracted from Action Pack to the `sprockets-rails`
    gem. `rails` gem is depending on `sprockets-rails` by default.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   `ActionDispatch::Session::MemCacheStore` now uses `dalli` instead of the deprecated
    `memcache-client` gem.

    *Arun Agrawal + Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Support multiple etags in If-None-Match header. *Travis Warlick*

*   Allow to configure how unverified request will be handled using `:with`
    option in `protect_from_forgery` method.

    Valid unverified request handling methods are:

    - `:exception` - Raises ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken exception.
    - `:reset_session` - Resets the session.
    - `:null_session` - Provides an empty session during request but doesn't
      reset it completely. Used as default if `:with` option is not specified.

    New applications are generated with:

        protect_from_forgery with: :exception

    *Sergey Nartimov*

*   Add `.ruby` template handler, this handler simply allows arbitrary Ruby code as a template. *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Add `separator` option for `ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#excerpt`:

        excerpt('This is a very beautiful morning', 'very', separator: ' ', radius: 1)
        # => ...a very beautiful...

    *Guirec Corbel*

*   Added controller-level etag additions that will be part of the action etag computation *Jeremy Kemper/DHH*

        class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
          etag { current_user.try :id }

          def show
            # Etag will differ even for the same invoice when it's viewed by a different current_user
            @invoice = Invoice.find(params[:id])
            fresh_when(@invoice)
          end
        end

*   Add automatic template digests to all `CacheHelper#cache` calls (originally spiked in the `cache_digests` plugin) *DHH*

*   When building a URL fails, add missing keys provided by Journey. Failed URL
    generation now returns a 500 status instead of a 404.

    *Richard Schneeman*

*   Deprecate availability of `ActionView::RecordIdentifier` in controllers by default.
    It's view specific and can be easily included in controllers manually if someone
    really needs it. Also deprecate calling `ActionController::RecordIdentifier.dom_id` and
    `dom_class` directly, in favor of `ActionView::RecordIdentifier.dom_id` and `dom_class`.
    `RecordIdentifier` will be removed from `ActionController::Base` in Rails 4.1.

    *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Fix `ActionView::RecordIdentifier` to work as a singleton. *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Deprecate `Template#mime_type`, it will be removed in Rails 4.1 in favor of `#type`.
    *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Move vendored html-scanner from `action_controller` to `action_view` directory. If you
    require it directly, please use 'action_view/vendor/html-scanner', reference to
    'action_controller/vendor/html-scanner' will be removed in Rails 4.1. *Piot Sarnacki*

*   Fix handling of date selects when using both disabled and discard options.
    Fixes #7431.

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   `ActiveRecord::SessionStore` is extracted out of Rails into a gem `activerecord-session_store`.
    Setting `config.session_store` to `:active_record_store` will no longer work and will break
    if the `activerecord-session_store` gem isn't available. *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Fix `select_tag` when `option_tags` is nil.
    Fixes #7404.

    *Sandeep Ravichandran*

*   Add `Request#formats=(extensions)` that lets you set multiple formats directly in a prioritized order.

    Example of using this for custom iphone views with an HTML fallback:

        class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
          before_filter :adjust_format_for_iphone_with_html_fallback

          private
            def adjust_format_for_iphone_with_html_fallback
              request.formats = [ :iphone, :html ] if request.env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"][/iPhone/]
            end
        end

    *DHH*

*   Add Routing Concerns to declare common routes that can be reused inside
    others resources and routes.

    Code before:

        resources :messages do
          resources :comments
        end

        resources :posts do
          resources :comments
          resources :images, only: :index
        end

    Code after:

        concern :commentable do
          resources :comments
        end

        concern :image_attachable do
          resources :images, only: :index
        end

        resources :messages, concerns: :commentable

        resources :posts, concerns: [:commentable, :image_attachable]

    *DHH + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add `start_hour` and `end_hour` options to the `select_hour` helper. *Evan Tann*

*   Raises an `ArgumentError` when the first argument in `form_for` contain `nil`
    or is empty.

    *Richard Schneeman*

*   Add 'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN'
    'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block' and
    'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff'
    as default headers.

    *Egor Homakov*

*   Allow data attributes to be set as a first-level option for `form_for`, so you can write `form_for @record, data: { behavior: 'autosave' }` instead of `form_for @record, html: { data: { behavior: 'autosave' } }` *DHH*

*   Deprecate `button_to_function` and `link_to_function` helpers.

    We recommend the use of Unobtrusive JavaScript instead. For example:

        link_to "Greeting", "#", class: "nav_link"

        $(function() {
          $('.nav_link').click(function() {
            // Some complex code

            return false;
          });
        });

    or

        link_to "Greeting", '#', onclick: "alert('Hello world!'); return false", class: "nav_link"

    for simple cases.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   `javascript_include_tag :all` will now not include `application.js` if the file does not exists. *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Send an empty response body when call `head` with status between 100 and 199, 204, 205 or 304.

    *Armand du Plessis*

*   Fixed issue with where digest authentication would not work behind a proxy. *Arthur Smith*

*   Added `ActionController::Live`.  Mix it in to your controller and you can
    stream data to the client live.  For example:

        class FooController < ActionController::Base
          include ActionController::Live

          def index
            100.times {
              # Client will see this as it's written
              response.stream.write "hello world\n"
              sleep 1
            }
            response.stream.close
          end
        end

    *Aaron Patterson*

*   Remove `ActionDispatch::Head` middleware in favor of `Rack::Head`. *Santiago Pastorino*

*   Deprecate `:confirm` in favor of `data: { confirm: "Text" }` option for `button_to`, `button_tag`, `image_submit_tag`, `link_to` and `submit_tag` helpers.

    *Carlos Galdino + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Show routes in exception page while debugging a `RoutingError` in development.

    *Richard Schneeman + Mattt Thompson + Yves Senn*

*   Add `ActionController::Flash.add_flash_types` method to allow people to register their own flash types. e.g.:

        class ApplicationController
          add_flash_types :error, :warning
        end

    If you add the above code, you can use `<%= error %>` in an erb, and `redirect_to /foo, error: 'message'` in a controller.

    *kennyj*

*   Remove Active Model dependency from Action Pack. *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Support unicode characters in routes. Route will be automatically escaped, so instead of manually escaping:

        get Rack::Utils.escape('こんにちは') => 'home#index'

    You just have to write the unicode route:

        get 'こんにちは' => 'home#index'

    *kennyj*

*   Return proper format on exceptions. *Santiago Pastorino*

*   Allow to use `mounted_helpers` (helpers for accessing mounted engines) in `ActionView::TestCase`. *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Include `mounted_helpers` (helpers for accessing mounted engines) in `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest` by default. *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Extracted redirect logic from `ActionController::ForceSSL::ClassMethods.force_ssl`  into `ActionController::ForceSSL#force_ssl_redirect`

    *Jeremy Friesen*

*   Make possible to use a block in `button_to` if the button text is hard
    to fit into the name parameter, e.g.:

        <%= button_to [:make_happy, @user] do %>
          Make happy <strong><%= @user.name %></strong>
        <% end %>
        # => "<form method="post" action="/users/1/make_happy" class="button_to">
        #      <div>
        #        <button type="submit">
        #          Make happy <strong>Name</strong>
        #        </button>
        #      </div>
        #    </form>"

    *Sergey Nartimov*

*   Change a way of ordering helpers from several directories. Previously,
    when loading helpers from multiple paths, all of the helpers files were
    gathered into one array an then they were sorted. Helpers from different
    directories should not be mixed before loading them to make loading more
    predictable. The most common use case for such behavior is loading helpers
    from engines. When you load helpers from application and engine Foo, in
    that order, first rails will load all of the helpers from application,
    sorted alphabetically and then it will do the same for Foo engine.

    *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   `truncate` now always returns an escaped HTML-safe string. The option `:escape` can be used as
    false to not escape the result.

    *Li Ellis Gallardo + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   `truncate` now accepts a block to show extra content when the text is truncated. *Li Ellis Gallardo*

*   Add `week_field`, `week_field_tag`, `month_field`, `month_field_tag`, `datetime_local_field`,
    `datetime_local_field_tag`, `datetime_field` and `datetime_field_tag` helpers. *Carlos Galdino*

*   Add `color_field` and `color_field_tag` helpers. *Carlos Galdino*

*   `assert_generates`, `assert_recognizes`, and `assert_routing` all raise
    `Assertion` instead of `RoutingError` *David Chelimsky*

*   URL path parameters with invalid encoding now raise `ActionController::BadRequest`. *Andrew White*

*   Malformed query and request parameter hashes now raise `ActionController::BadRequest`. *Andrew White*

*   Add `divider` option to `grouped_options_for_select` to generate a separator
    `optgroup` automatically, and deprecate `prompt` as third argument, in favor
    of using an options hash. *Nicholas Greenfield*

*   Add `time_field` and `time_field_tag` helpers which render an `input[type="time"]` tag. *Alex Soulim*

*   Removed old text helper apis from `highlight`, `excerpt` and `word_wrap`. *Jeremy Walker*

*   Templates without a handler extension now raises a deprecation warning but still
    defaults to ERB. In future releases, it will simply return the template contents. *Steve Klabnik*

*   Deprecate `:disable_with` in favor of `data: { disable_with: "Text" }` option from `submit_tag`, `button_tag` and `button_to` helpers.

    *Carlos Galdino + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Remove `:mouseover` option from `image_tag` helper. *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   The `select` method (select tag) forces `:include_blank` if `required` is true and
    `display size` is one and `multiple` is not true. *Angelo Capilleri*

*   Copy literal route constraints to defaults so that url generation know about them.
    The copied constraints are `:protocol`, `:subdomain`, `:domain`, `:host` and `:port`.

    *Andrew White*

*   `respond_to` and `respond_with` now raise `ActionController::UnknownFormat` instead
    of directly returning head 406. The exception is rescued and converted to 406
    in the exception handling middleware. *Steven Soroka*

*   Allows `assert_redirected_to` to match against a regular expression. *Andy Lindeman*

*   Add backtrace to development routing error page. *Richard Schneeman*

*   Replace `include_seconds` boolean argument with `include_seconds: true` option
    in `distance_of_time_in_words` and `time_ago_in_words` signature. *Dmitriy Kiriyenko*

*   Make current object and counter (when it applies) variables accessible when
    rendering templates with :object / :collection. *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   JSONP now uses mimetype `text/javascript` instead of `application/json`. *omjokine*

*   Allow to lazy load `default_form_builder` by passing a `String` instead of a constant. *Piotr Sarnacki*

*   Session arguments passed to `process` calls in functional tests are now merged into
    the existing session, whereas previously they would replace the existing session.
    This change may break some existing tests if they are asserting the exact contents of
    the session but should not break existing tests that only assert individual keys.

    *Andrew White*

*   In the routes DSL the `:via` option of `match` is now mandatory.

    For routes that respond to one single verb it is recommended to use the more specific
    macros `get`, `post`, etc. instead. You can still map all HTTP verbs to one action
    with `match`, but it has to be explictly configured using `:via => :all`.

    *José Valim and Yehuda Katz*

*   Add `index` method to FormBuilder class. *Jorge Bejar*

*   Remove the leading \n added by textarea on `assert_select`. *Santiago Pastorino*

*   Changed default value for `config.action_view.embed_authenticity_token_in_remote_forms`
    to `false`. This change breaks remote forms that need to work also without JavaScript,
    so if you need such behavior, you can either set it to `true` or explicitly pass
    `authenticity_token: true` in form options.

*   Added `ActionDispatch::SSL` middleware that when included force all the requests to be under HTTPS protocol. *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add `include_hidden` option to select tag. With `include_hidden: false` select with `multiple` attribute doesn't generate hidden input with blank value. *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Removed default `size` option from the `text_field`, `search_field`, `telephone_field`, `url_field`, `email_field` helpers. *Philip Arndt*

*   Removed default `cols` and `rows` options from the `text_area` helper. *Philip Arndt*

*   Adds support for layouts when rendering a partial with a given collection. *serabe*

*   Allows the route helper `root` to take a string argument. For example, `root 'pages#main'`. *bcardarella*

*   Forms of persisted records use always PATCH (via the `_method` hack). *fxn*

*   For resources, both PATCH and PUT are routed to the `update` action. *fxn*

*   Don't ignore `force_ssl` in development. This is a change of behavior - use a `:if` condition to recreate the old behavior.

        class AccountsController < ApplicationController
          force_ssl if: :ssl_configured?

          def ssl_configured?
            !Rails.env.development?
          end
        end

    *Pat Allan*

*   Adds support for the PATCH verb:
      * Request objects respond to `patch?`.
      * Routes have a new `patch` method, and understand `:patch` in the
        existing places where a verb is configured, like `:via`.
      * New method `patch` available in functional tests.
      * If `:patch` is the default verb for updates, edits are
        tunneled as PATCH rather than as PUT, and routing acts accordingly.
      * New method `patch_via_redirect` available in integration tests.

    *dlee*

*   `expires_in` accepts a `must_revalidate` flag. If true, "must-revalidate"
    is added to the Cache-Control header. *fxn*

*   Add `date_field` and `date_field_tag` helpers which render an `input[type="date"]` tag *Olek Janiszewski*

*   Adds `image_url`, `javascript_url`, `stylesheet_url`, `audio_url`, `video_url`, and `font_url`
    to assets tag helper. These URL helpers will return the full path to your assets. This is useful
    when you are going to reference this asset from external host. *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Default responder will now always use your overridden block in `respond_with` to render your response. *Prem Sichanugrist*

*   Allow `value_method` and `text_method` arguments from `collection_select` and
    `options_from_collection_for_select` to receive an object that responds to `:call`,
    such as a `proc`, to evaluate the option in the current element context. This works
    the same way with `collection_radio_buttons` and `collection_check_boxes`.

    *Carlos Antonio da Silva + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add `collection_check_boxes` form helper, similar to `collection_select`:
    Example:

        collection_check_boxes :post, :author_ids, Author.all, :id, :name
        # Outputs something like:
        <input id="post_author_ids_1" name="post[author_ids][]" type="checkbox" value="1" />
        <label for="post_author_ids_1">D. Heinemeier Hansson</label>
        <input id="post_author_ids_2" name="post[author_ids][]" type="checkbox" value="2" />
        <label for="post_author_ids_2">D. Thomas</label>
        <input name="post[author_ids][]" type="hidden" value="" />

    The label/check_box pairs can be customized with a block.

    *Carlos Antonio da Silva + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add `collection_radio_buttons` form helper, similar to `collection_select`:
    Example:

        collection_radio_buttons :post, :author_id, Author.all, :id, :name
        # Outputs something like:
        <input id="post_author_id_1" name="post[author_id]" type="radio" value="1" />
        <label for="post_author_id_1">D. Heinemeier Hansson</label>
        <input id="post_author_id_2" name="post[author_id]" type="radio" value="2" />
        <label for="post_author_id_2">D. Thomas</label>

    The label/radio_button pairs can be customized with a block.

    *Carlos Antonio da Silva + Rafael Mendonça França*

*   `check_box` with `:form` html5 attribute will now replicate the `:form`
    attribute to the hidden field as well. *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   `label` form helper accepts `for: nil` to not generate the attribute. *Carlos Antonio da Silva*

*   Add `:format` option to `number_to_percentage`. *Rodrigo Flores*

*   Add `config.action_view.logger` to configure logger for Action View. *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Deprecated `ActionController::Integration` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Integration`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::IntegrationTest` in favour of `ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::PerformanceTest` in favour of `ActionDispatch::PerformanceTest`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::AbstractRequest` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Request`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::Request` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Request`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::AbstractResponse` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Response`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::Response` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Response`.

*   Deprecated `ActionController::Routing` in favour of `ActionDispatch::Routing`.

*   `check_box helper` with `disabled: true` will generate a disabled
    hidden field to conform with the HTML convention where disabled fields are
    not submitted with the form. This is a behavior change, previously the hidden
    tag had a value of the disabled checkbox. *Tadas Tamosauskas*

*   `favicon_link_tag` helper will now use the favicon in app/assets by default. *Lucas Caton*

*   `ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper#highlight` now defaults to the
    HTML5 `mark` element. *Brian Cardarella*
