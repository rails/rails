## Unreleased

*   Change the request method to a `GET` when passing failed requests down to `config.exceptions_app`.

    *Alex Robbin*

*   Add `redirect_back_or_to(fallback_location, **)` as a more aesthetically pleasing version of `redirect_back fallback_location:, **`.
    The old method name is retained without explicit deprecation.

    *DHH*
