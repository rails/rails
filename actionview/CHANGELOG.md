*   Add an `attributes` method to all form tags.

    This allows generating input attributes without using the tags, so they can be used elsewhere

    *Cirdes Henrique*

*   Enable DependencyTracker to evaluate renders with trailing interpolation.

    ```erb
    <%= render "maintenance_tasks/runs/info/#{run.status}" %>
    ```

    Previously, the DependencyTracker would ignore this render, but now it will
    mark all partials in the "maintenance_tasks/runs/info" folder as
    dependencies.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Rename `text_area` methods into `textarea`

    Old names are still available as aliases.

    *Sean Doyle*

*   Rename `check_box*` methods into `checkbox*`.

    Old names are still available as aliases.

    *Jean Boussier*
