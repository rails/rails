*   Fix `ActionView::TestCase#render` to reset `rendered`.
    The behavior was changed when memoization was added in #51093. Now it once again conforms to the documentation.

    *Jeroen Versteeg*

*   Fix tag parameter content being overwritten instead of combined with tag block content.
    Before `tag.div("Hello ") { "World" }` would just return `<div>World</div>`, now it returns `<div>Hello World</div>`.

    *DHH*

*   Add ability to pass a block when rendering collection. The block will be executed for each rendered element in the collection.

    *Vincent Robert*

*   Add `key:` and `expires_in:` options under `cached:` to `render` when used with `collection:`

    *Jarrett Lusso*
