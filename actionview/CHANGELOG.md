*   Fix and add protections for XSS in `ActionView::Helpers` and `ERB::Util`.

    Escape dangerous characters in names of tags and names of attributes in the
    tag helpers, following the XML specification. Rename the option
    `:escape_attributes` to `:escape`, to simplify by applying the option to the
    whole tag.

*   Extend audio_tag and video_tag to accept Active Storage attachments.

    Now it's possible to write

    ```ruby
    audio_tag(user.audio_file)
    video_tag(user.video_file)
    ```

    Instead of

    ```ruby
    audio_tag(polymorphic_path(user.audio_file))
    video_tag(polymorphic_path(user.video_file))
    ```

    `image_tag` already supported that, so this follows the same pattern.

*   Ensure models passed to `form_for` attempt to call `to_model`.
