*   Render `[accept-charset="UTF-8"]` on `<form>` elements rendered by
    `button_to`

## Rails 8.0.0.beta1 (September 26, 2024) ##

*   Enable DependencyTracker to evaluate renders with trailing interpolation.

    ```erb
    <%= render "maintenance_tasks/runs/info/#{run.status}" %>
    ```

    Previously, the DependencyTracker would ignore this render, but now it will
    mark all partials in the "maintenance_tasks/runs/info" folder as
    dependencies.

*   Rename `check_box*` methods into `checkbox*`.
