# = Active Storage \Variation
#
# A set of transformations that can be applied to a blob to create a variant. This class is exposed via
# the ActiveStorage::Blob#variant method and should rarely be used directly.
#
# In case you do need to use this directly, it's instantiated using a hash of transformations where
# the key is the command and the value is the arguments. Example:
#
#   ActiveStorage::Variation.new(resize_to_limit: [100, 100], colourspace: "b-w", rotate: "-90", saver: { trim: true })
#
# The options map directly to {ImageProcessing}[https://github.com/janko/image_processing] commands.
