# = Active Storage \Variant
#
# Image blobs can have variants that are the result of a set of transformations applied to the original.
# These variants are used to create thumbnails, fixed-size avatars, or any other derivative image from the
# original.
#
# Variants rely on {ImageProcessing}[https://github.com/janko/image_processing] gem for the actual transformations
# of the file, so you must add <tt>gem "image_processing"</tt> to your Gemfile if you wish to use variants. By
# default, images will be processed with {ImageMagick}[http://imagemagick.org] using the
# {MiniMagick}[https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick] gem, but you can also switch to the
# {libvips}[http://libvips.github.io/libvips/] processor operated by the {ruby-vips}[https://github.com/libvips/ruby-vips]
# gem).
#
#   Rails.application.config.active_storage.variant_processor
#   # => :mini_magick
#
#   Rails.application.config.active_storage.variant_processor = :vips
#   # => :vips
#
# Note that to create a variant it's necessary to download the entire blob file from the service. Because of this process,
# you also want to be considerate about when the variant is actually processed. You shouldn't be processing variants inline
# in a template, for example. Delay the processing to an on-demand controller, like the one provided in
# ActiveStorage::RepresentationsController.
#
# To refer to such a delayed on-demand variant, simply link to the variant through the resolved route provided
# by Active Storage like so:
#
#   <%= image_tag Current.user.avatar.variant(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]) %>
#
# This will create a URL for that specific blob with that specific variant, which the ActiveStorage::RepresentationsController
# can then produce on-demand.
#
# When you do want to actually produce the variant needed, call +processed+. This will check that the variant
# has already been processed and uploaded to the service, and, if so, just return that. Otherwise it will perform
# the transformations, upload the variant to the service, and return itself again. Example:
#
#   avatar.variant(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]).processed.url
#
# This will create and process a variant of the avatar blob that's constrained to a height and width of 100.
# Then it'll upload said variant to the service according to a derivative key of the blob and the transformations.
#
# You can combine any number of ImageMagick/libvips operations into a variant, as well as any macros provided by the
# ImageProcessing gem (such as +resize_to_limit+):
#
#   avatar.variant(resize_to_limit: [800, 800], colourspace: "b-w", rotate: "-90")
