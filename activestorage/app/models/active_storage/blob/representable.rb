  # Returns an ActiveStorage::Variant or ActiveStorage::VariantWithRecord instance with the set of +transformations+ provided.
  # This is only relevant for image files, and it allows any image to be transformed for size, colors, and the like. Example:
  #
  #   avatar.variant(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]).processed.url
  #
  # This will create and process a variant of the avatar blob that's constrained to a height and width of 100px.
  # Then it'll upload said variant to the service according to a derivative key of the blob and the transformations.
  #
  # Frequently, though, you don't actually want to transform the variant right away. But rather simply refer to a
  # specific variant that can be created by a controller on-demand. Like so:
  #
  #   <%= image_tag Current.user.avatar.variant(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]) %>
  #
  # This will create a URL for that specific blob with that specific variant, which the ActiveStorage::RepresentationsController
  # can then produce on-demand.
  #
  # Raises ActiveStorage::InvariableError if the variant processor cannot
  # transform the blob. To determine whether a blob is variable, call
  # ActiveStorage::Blob#variable?.

  # type is in +ActiveStorage.variable_content_types+).

  # Returns an ActiveStorage::Preview instance with the set of +transformations+ provided. A preview is an image generated
  # from a non-image blob. Active Storage comes with built-in previewers for videos and PDF documents. The video previewer
  # extracts the first frame from a video and the PDF previewer extracts the first page from a PDF document.
  #
  #   blob.preview(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]).processed.url
  #
  # Avoid processing previews synchronously in views. Instead, link to a controller action that processes them on demand.
  # Active Storage provides one, but you may want to create your own (for example, if you need authentication). Hereâ€™s
  # how to use the built-in version:
  #
  #   <%= image_tag video.preview(resize_to_limit: [100, 100]) %>
  #
  # This method raises ActiveStorage::UnpreviewableError if no previewer accepts the receiving blob. To determine
  # whether a blob is accepted by any previewer, call ActiveStorage::Blob#previewable?.
