## Rails 6.0.0.alpha (Unreleased) ##

*   Rails 6 requires Ruby 2.4.1 or newer.

    *Jeremy Daer*

*   Add source code to published npm package

    This allows activestorage users to depend on the javascript source code
    rather than the compiled code, which can produce smaller javascript bundles.

    *Richard Macklin*


Please check [5-2-stable](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5-2-stable/activestorage/CHANGELOG.md) for previous changes.
