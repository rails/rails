      # There is no column defined on the model side, Active Storage takes
      # care of the mapping between your records and the attachment.
      #
      # Under the covers, this relationship is implemented as a +has_one+ association to a
      # ActiveStorage::Attachment record and a +has_one-through+ association to a
      # ActiveStorage::Blob record. These associations are available as +avatar_attachment+
      # and +avatar_blob+. But you shouldn't need to work with these associations directly in
      # most circumstances.
      #
      # Instead, +has_one_attached+ generates an ActiveStorage::Attached::One proxy to
      # provide access to the associations and factory methods, like +attach+:
      #
      #   user.avatar.attach(uploaded_file)
      #
      # The +:dependent+ option defaults to +:purge_later+. This means the attachment will be
      # purged (i.e. destroyed) in the background whenever the record is destroyed.
      # If an ActiveJob::Backend queue adapter is not set in the application set it to
      # +purge+ instead.
      #
      # If you need the attachment to use a service which differs from the globally configured one,
      # pass the +:service+ option. For example:
      #
      #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_one_attached :avatar, service: :s3
      #   end
      #
      # +:service+ can also be specified as a proc, and it will be called with the model instance:
      #
      #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_one_attached :avatar, service: ->(user) { user.in_europe_region? ? :s3_europe : :s3_usa }
      #   end
      #
      # To avoid N+1 queries, you can include the attached blobs in your query like so:
      #
      #   User.with_attached_avatar
      #
      # If you need to enable +strict_loading+ to prevent lazy loading of attachment,
      # pass the +:strict_loading+ option. You can do:
      #
      #   class User < ApplicationRecord
      #     has_one_attached :avatar, strict_loading: true
      #   end
      #
