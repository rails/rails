*   Fix compatibility with the `semantic_logger` gem.

    The `semantic_logger` gem doesn't behave exactly like stdlib logger in that
    `SemanticLogger#level` returns a Symbol while stdlib `Logger#level` returns an Integer.

    This caused the various `LogSubscriber` classes in Rails to break when assigned a
    `SemanticLogger` instance.

*   Fix MemoryStore to prevent race conditions when incrementing or decrementing.

    *Pierre Jambet*

*   Implement `HashWithIndifferentAccess#to_proc`.

    Previously, calling `#to_proc` on `HashWithIndifferentAccess` object used inherited `#to_proc`
    method from the `Hash` class, which was not able to access values using indifferent keys.
