  # Provides a +delegate+ class method to easily expose contained objects'
  # public methods as your own.
  #
  # ==== Options
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - Specifies the target object
  # * <tt>:prefix</tt> - Prefixes the new method with the target name or a custom prefix
  # * <tt>:allow_nil</tt> - if set to true, prevents a +Module::DelegationError+
  #   from being raised
  #
  # The macro receives one or more method names (specified as symbols or
  # strings) and the name of the target object via the <tt>:to</tt> option
  # (also a symbol or string).
  #
  # Delegation is particularly useful with Active Record associations:
  #
  #   class Greeter < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def hello
  #       'hello'
  #     end
  #
  #     def goodbye
  #       'goodbye'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello   # => "hello"
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => NoMethodError: undefined method `goodbye' for #<Foo:0x1af30c>
  #
  # Multiple delegates to the same target are allowed:
  #
  #   class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     belongs_to :greeter
  #     delegate :hello, :goodbye, to: :greeter
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.goodbye # => "goodbye"
  #
  # Methods can be delegated to instance variables, class variables, or constants
  # by providing them as a symbols:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     CONSTANT_ARRAY = [0,1,2,3]
  #     @@class_array  = [4,5,6,7]
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       @instance_array = [8,9,10,11]
  #     end
  #     delegate :sum, to: :CONSTANT_ARRAY
  #     delegate :min, to: :@@class_array
  #     delegate :max, to: :@instance_array
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.sum # => 6
  #   Foo.new.min # => 4
  #   Foo.new.max # => 11
  #
  # It's also possible to delegate a method to the class by using +:class+:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     def self.hello
  #       "world"
  #     end
  #
  #     delegate :hello, to: :class
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new.hello # => "world"
  #
  # Delegates can optionally be prefixed using the <tt>:prefix</tt> option. If the value
  # is <tt>true</tt>, the delegate methods are prefixed with the name of the object being
  # delegated to.
  #
  #   Person = Struct.new(:name, :address)
  #
  #   class Invoice < Struct.new(:client)
  #     delegate :name, :address, to: :client, prefix: true
  #   end
  #
  #   john_doe = Person.new('John Doe', 'Vimmersvej 13')
  #   invoice = Invoice.new(john_doe)
  #   invoice.client_name    # => "John Doe"
  #   invoice.client_address # => "Vimmersvej 13"
  #
  # It is also possible to supply a custom prefix.
  #
  #   class Invoice < Struct.new(:client)
  #     delegate :name, :address, to: :client, prefix: :customer
  #   end
  #
  #   invoice = Invoice.new(john_doe)
  #   invoice.customer_name    # => 'John Doe'
  #   invoice.customer_address # => 'Vimmersvej 13'
  #
  # If the target is +nil+ and does not respond to the delegated method a
  # +Module::DelegationError+ is raised. If you wish to instead return +nil+,
  # use the <tt>:allow_nil</tt> option.
  #
  #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_one :profile
  #     delegate :age, to: :profile
  #   end
  #
  #   User.new.age
  #   # => Module::DelegationError: User#age delegated to profile.age, but profile is nil
  #
  # But if not having a profile yet is fine and should not be an error
  # condition:
  #
  #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_one :profile
  #     delegate :age, to: :profile, allow_nil: true
  #   end
  #
  #   User.new.age # nil
  #
  # Note that if the target is not +nil+ then the call is attempted regardless of the
  # <tt>:allow_nil</tt> option, and thus an exception is still raised if said object
  # does not respond to the method:
  #
  #   class Foo
  #     def initialize(bar)
  #       @bar = bar
  #     end
  #
  #     delegate :name, to: :@bar, allow_nil: true
  #   end
  #
  #   Foo.new("Bar").name # raises NoMethodError: undefined method `name'
  #
  # The target method must be public, otherwise it will raise +NoMethodError+.
