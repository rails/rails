class Object
  # An elegant way to factor duplication out of options passed to a series of
  # method calls. Each method called in the block, with the block variable as
  # the receiver, will have its options merged with the default +options+
  # <tt>Hash</tt> or <tt>Hash</tt>-like object provided. Each method called on
  # the block variable must take an options hash as its final argument.
  #
  # Without <tt>with_options</tt>, this code contains duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :customers, dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :products,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :invoices,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :expenses,  dependent: :destroy
  #   end
  #
  # Using <tt>with_options</tt>, we can remove the duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do |assoc|
  #       assoc.has_many :customers
  #       assoc.has_many :products
  #       assoc.has_many :invoices
  #       assoc.has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It can also be used with an explicit receiver:
  #
  #   I18n.with_options locale: user.locale, scope: 'newsletter' do |i18n|
  #     subject i18n.t :subject
  #     body    i18n.t :body, user_name: user.name
  #   end
  #
  # When you don't pass an explicit receiver, it executes the whole block
  # in merging options context:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do
  #       has_many :customers
  #       has_many :products
  #       has_many :invoices
  #       has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # <tt>with_options</tt> can also be nested since the call is forwarded to its receiver.
  #
  # NOTE: Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to their own.
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options if: :persisted?, length: { minimum: 50 } do
  #       validates :content, if: -> { content.present? }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The code is equivalent to:
  #
  #   validates :content, length: { minimum: 50 }, if: -> { content.present? }
  #
  # Hence the inherited default for +if+ key is ignored.
  #
  # NOTE: You cannot call class methods implicitly inside of +with_options+.
  # You can access these methods using the class name instead:
  #
  #   class Phone < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     enum :phone_number_type, { home: 0, office: 1, mobile: 2 }
  #
  #     with_options presence: true do
  #       validates :phone_number_type, inclusion: { in: Phone.phone_number_types.keys }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # When the block argument is omitted, the decorated Object instance is returned:
  #
  #   module MyStyledHelpers
  #     def styled
  #       with_options style: "color: red;"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   styled.link_to "I'm red", "/"
  #   # => <a href="/" style="color: red;">I'm red</a>
  #
  #   styled.button_tag "I'm red too!"
  #   # => <button style="color: red;">I'm red too!</button>
  #
  def with_options(options, &block)
    option_merger = ActiveSupport::OptionMerger.new(self, options)

    if block
      block.arity.zero? ? option_merger.instance_eval(&block) : block.call(option_merger)
    else
      option_merger
    end
  end
end
