  # = \File Update Checker
  #
  # FileUpdateChecker specifies the API used by \Rails to watch files
  # and control reloading. The API depends on four methods:
  #
  # * +initialize+ which expects two parameters and one block as
  #   described below.
  #
  # * +updated?+ which returns a boolean if there were updates in
  #   the filesystem or not.
  #
  # * +execute+ which executes the given block on initialization
  #   and updates the latest watched files and timestamp.
  #
  # * +execute_if_updated+ which just executes the block if it was updated.
  #
  # After initialization, a call to +execute_if_updated+ must execute
  # the block only if there was really a change in the filesystem.
  #
  # This class is used by \Rails to reload the I18n framework whenever
  # they are changed upon a new request.
  #
  #   i18n_reloader = ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker.new(paths) do
  #     I18n.reload!
  #   end
  #
  #   ActiveSupport::Reloader.to_prepare do
  #     i18n_reloader.execute_if_updated
  #   end
  class FileUpdateChecker
    # It accepts two parameters on initialization. The first is an array
    # of files and the second is an optional hash of directories. The hash must
    # have directories as keys and the value is an array of extensions to be
    # watched under that directory.
    #
    # This method must also receive a block that will be called once a path
    # changes. The array of files and list of directories cannot be changed
    # after FileUpdateChecker has been initialized.
