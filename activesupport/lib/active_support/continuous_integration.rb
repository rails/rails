module ActiveSupport
  # Provides a DSL for declaring a continuous integration workflow that can be run either locally or in the cloud.
  # Each step is timed, reports success/error, and is aggregated into a collective report that reports total runtime,
  # as well as whether the entire run was successful or not.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   ActiveSupport::ContinuousIntegration.run do
  #     step "Setup", "bin/setup --skip-server"
  #     step "Style: Ruby", "bin/rubocop"
  #     step "Security: Gem audit", "bin/bundler-audit"
  #     step "Tests: Rails", "bin/rails test test:system"
  #
  #     if success?
  #       step "Signoff: Ready for merge and deploy", "gh signoff"
  #     else
  #       failure "Skipping signoff; CI failed.", "Fix the issues and try again."
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Starting with Rails 8.1, a default `bin/ci` and `config/ci.rb` file are created to provide out-of-the-box CI.
  class ContinuousIntegration
    COLORS = {
      banner: "\033[1;32m",   # Green
      title: "\033[1;35m",    # Purple
      subtitle: "\033[1;90m", # Medium Gray
      error: "\033[1;31m",    # Red
      success: "\033[1;32m",  # Green
      progress: "\033[1;36m"  # Cyan
    }

    # Perform a CI run. Execute each step, show their results and runtime, and exit with a non-zero status if there are any failures.
    #
    # Pass an optional title, subtitle, and a block that declares the steps to be executed.
    #
    # Sets the CI environment variable to "true" to allow for conditional behavior in the app, like enabling eager loading and disabling logging.
    #
    # A 'fail fast' option can be passed as a CLI argument (-f or --fail-fast). This exits with a non-zero status directly after a step fails.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   ActiveSupport::ContinuousIntegration.run do
    #     step "Setup", "bin/setup --skip-server"

    # Declare a group of steps that can be run in parallel. Steps within the group are collected first,

    # display shows which steps are currently running.
    #
    # Sub-groups within a parallel group occupy a single parallel slot and run their steps sequentially.

    # Examples:
    #
    #   group "Checks", parallel: 3 do
