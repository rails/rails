*Rails 3.0.2 (November 15, 2010)*

* Added before_remove_const callback to ActiveSupport::Dependencies.remove_unloadable_constants! [Andrew White]


*Rails 3.0.1 (October 15, 2010)*

* No changes.


*Rails 3.0.0 (August 29, 2010)*

* Implemented String#strip_heredoc. [fxn]

* Pluggable cache stores: setting config.cache_store = "custom_store" will require 'active_support/cache/custom_store' and look for the CustomStore constant.  #5486 [Mike Perham]

* Removed Object#returning, Object#tap should be used instead. [Santiago Pastorino]

* Deprecation behavior is no longer hardcoded to the name of the environment.
  Instead, it is set via config.active_support.deprecation and can be one
  of :log, :stderr or :notify. :notify is a new style that sends the warning
  via ActiveSupport::Notifications, and is the new default for production
  [Yehuda Katz]

* Renamed ActiveSupport::Dependecies.load_(once_)paths to autoload_(once_)paths. [fxn]

* Added ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker to execute a block only if a set of files changed, used by Router and I18n locale files. [José Valim]

* Added ActiveSupport::DescendantsTracker to track descendants with support to constants reloading. [José Valim]

* ActiveSupport::OrderedHash#merge and #merge! accept a block. #4838 [Paul Mucur, fxn]

* Date#since, #ago, #beginning_of_day, #end_of_day, and #xmlschema honor now the user time zone if set. [Geoff Buesing]

* Extracted String#truncate from TextHelper#truncate [DHH]

* Ruby 1.9: support UTF-8 case folding.  #4595 [Norman Clarke]

* Removes Array#rand and backports Array#sample from Ruby 1.9, thanks to Marc-Andre Lafortune. [fxn]

* Ruby 1.9: Renames last_(month|year) to prev_(month|year) in Date and Time. [fxn]

* Aliases Date#sunday to Date#end_of_week. [fxn]

* Backports Date#>> from 1.9 so that calculations do the right thing around the calendar reform. [fxn]

* Date#to_time handles properly years in the range 0..138. [fxn]

* Deprecate {{}} as interpolation syntax for I18n in favor of %{} [José Valim]

* Array#to_xml is more powerful and able to handle the same types as Hash#to_xml #4490 [Neeraj Singh]

* Harmonize the caching API and refactor the backends.  #4452 [Brian Durand]
  All caches:
  * Add default options to initializer that will be sent to all read, write, fetch, exist?, increment, and decrement
  * Add support for the :expires_in option to fetch and write for all caches. Cache entries are stored with the create timestamp and a ttl so that expiration can be handled independently of the implementation.
  * Add support for a :namespace option. This can be used to set a global prefix for cache entries.
  * Deprecate expand_cache_key on ActiveSupport::Cache and move it to ActionController::Caching and ActionDispatch::Http::Cache since the logic in the method used some Rails specific environment variables and was only used by ActionPack classes. Not very DRY but there didn't seem to be a good shared spot and ActiveSupport really shouldn't be Rails specific.
  * Add support for :race_condition_ttl to fetch. This setting can prevent race conditions on fetch calls where several processes try to regenerate a recently expired entry at once.
  * Add support for :compress option to fetch and write which will compress any data over a configurable threshold.
  * Nil values can now be stored in the cache and are distinct from cache misses for fetch.
  * Easier API to create new implementations. Just need to implement the methods read_entry, write_entry, and delete_entry instead of overwriting existing methods.
  * Since all cache implementations support storing objects, update the docs to state that ActiveCache::Cache::Store implementations should store objects. Keys, however, must be strings since some implementations require that.
  * Increase test coverage.
  * Document methods which are provided as convenience but which may not be universally available.

  MemoryStore:
  * MemoryStore can now safely be used as the cache for single server sites.
  * Make thread safe so that the default cache implementation used by Rails is thread safe. The overhead is minimal and it is still the fastest store available.
  * Provide :size initialization option indicating the maximum size of the cache in memory (defaults to 32Mb).
  * Add prune logic that removes the least recently used cache entries to keep the cache size from exceeding the max.
  * Deprecated SynchronizedMemoryStore since it isn't needed anymore.

  FileStore:
  * Escape key values so they will work as file names on all file systems, be consistent, and case sensitive
  * Use a hash algorithm to segment the cache into sub directories so that a large cache doesn't exceed file system limits.
  * FileStore can be slow so implement the LocalCache strategy to cache reads for the duration of a request.
  * Add cleanup method to keep the disk from filling up with expired entries.
  * Fix increment and decrement to use file system locks so they are consistent between processes.

  MemCacheStore:
  * Support all keys. Previously keys with spaces in them would fail
  * Deprecate CompressedMemCacheStore since it isn't needed anymore (use :compress => true)

* JSON: encode objects that don't have a native JSON representation using to_hash, if available, instead of instance_values (the old fallback) or to_s (other encoders' default). Encode BigDecimal and Regexp encode as strings to conform with other encoders. Try to transcode non-UTF-8 strings.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* HashWithIndifferentAccess: remove inherited symbolize_keys! since its keys are always strings.  [Santiago Pastorino]

* Improve transliteration quality.  #4374 [Norman Clarke]

* Speed up and add Ruby 1.9 support for ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars#tidy_bytes.  #4350 [Norman Clarke]

* Reduced load time by deferring configuration of classes using
  ActiveSupport::on_load(:component_name) [YK]

* Rename #metaclass to #singleton_class now that ruby-core has decided [JK]

* New assertions assert_blank and assert_present.  #4299 [Juanjo Bazan]

* Use Object#singleton_class instead of #metaclass. Prefer Ruby's choice.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* JSON backend for YAJL. Preferred if available.  #2666 [Brian Lopez]

* Introduce class_attribute to declare inheritable class attributes. Writing an attribute on a subclass behaves just like overriding the superclass reader method.  Unifies and replaces most usage of cattr_accessor, class_inheritable_attribute, superclass_delegating_attribute, and extlib_inheritable_attribute.  [Jeremy Kemper, Yehuda Katz]

* Time#- with a DateTime argument behaves the same as with a Time argument, i.e. returns the difference between self and arg as a Float #3476 [Geoff Buesing]

* YAML serialization for OrderedHash.  #3608 [Gregor Schmidt]

* Update bundled TZInfo to v0.3.16 [Geoff Buesing]

* Georgetown TimeZone is now mapped to "America/Guyana" instead of "America/Argentina/San_Juan" #1821 [Geoff Buesing, Reuben Sivan]

* Changed the default ActiveSupport.use_standard_json_time_format from false to true and
ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json from true to false to match previously announced Rails 3 defaults [DHH]

* Added Object#presence that returns the object if it's #present? otherwise returns nil [DHH/Colin Kelley]

* Add Enumerable#exclude? to bring parity to Enumerable#include? and avoid if !x.include?/else calls [DHH]

* Update Edinburgh TimeZone to use "Europe/London" instead of "Europe/Dublin" #3310 [Phil Ross]

* Update bundled TZInfo to v0.3.15 [Geoff Buesing]

* JSON: +Object#to_json+ calls +as_json+ to coerce itself into something natively encodable like +Hash+, +Integer+, or +String+. Override +as_json+ instead of +to_json+ so you're JSON library agnostic.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* String #to_time and #to_datetime: handle fractional seconds #864 [Jason Frey]

* Update bundled TZInfo to v0.3.13 [Geoff Buesing]

* Allow MemCacheStore to be initialized with a MemCache-like object instead of addresses and options [Bryan Helmkamp]

* Change spelling of Kyev timezone to Kyiv #2613 [Alexander Dymo]

* Add ActiveSupport.parse_json_times to disable time parsing in JSON backends that don't support it or don't need it. [rick]

* Add pluggable JSON backends with support for the JSON gem. [rick]
    Example: ActiveSupport::JSON.backend = "JSONGem"

 All internal Rails JSON encoding is now handled by ActiveSupport::JSON.encode().  Use of #to_json is not recommended, as it may clash with other libraries that overwrite it.  However, you can recover Rails specific functionality
 if you really want to use #to_json.

    gem 'json'
    ActiveSupport::JSON.backend = "JSONGem"

    class ActiveRecord::Base
      alias to_json rails_to_json
    end

* require 'active_support' no longer orders the whole menu of core extensions. Ask for just what you need: e.g. require 'active_support/core/time' to use timezones, durations, and stdlib date/time extensions. [Jeremy Kemper]

* Removed rarely-used DRb cache store.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* TimeWithZone.name returns 'Time', to further thwart type checking [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.local instances: Adding 24.hours across the DST boundary adds 24 hours instead of one day #2066 [Michael Curtis]


*2.3.2 [Final] (March 15, 2009)*

* XmlMini supports LibXML and Nokogiri backends.  #2084, #2190 [Bart ten Brinke, Aaron Patterson]
    Example: XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri'

* Vendorize i18n 0.1.3 gem (fixes issues with incompatible character encodings in Ruby 1.9) #2038 [Akira Matsuda]

* Update bundled memcache-client from 1.5.0.5 to 1.6.4.99. See http://www.mikeperham.com/2009/02/15/memcache-client-performance/  [Mike Perham]

* Ruby 1.9.1p0 fix: URI.unescape can decode multibyte chars.  #2033 [MOROHASHI Kyosuke]

* Time#to_s(:rfc822) uses #formatted_offset instead of unreliable and non-standard %z directive #1899 [Zachary Zolton]

* Make TimeWithZone#to_formatted_s an alias to TimeWithZone#to_s #1796 [Levin Alexander]

* Introduce Array.wrap(foo) to wrap the argument in an array unless it's already an array. Wraps nil as an empty array. Use instead of Array(foo) and foo.to_a since they treat String as Enumerable.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* TimeWithZone#xmlschema accepts optional fraction_digits argument [#1725 state:resolved] [Nicholas Dainty]

* Object#tap shim for Ruby < 1.8.7. Similar to Object#returning, tap yields self then returns self.  [Jeremy Kemper]
    array.select { ... }.tap(&:inspect).map { ... }

* TimeWithZone#- gives correct result with wrapped DateTime, and with DateTime argument [Geoff Buesing]

* Updated i18n gem to version 0.1.1 #1635 [Yaroslav Markin]

* Add :allow_nil option to delegate. #1127 [Sergio Gil]

* Add Benchmark.ms convenience method to benchmark realtime in milliseconds.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Updated included memcache-client to the 1.5.0.5 version which includes fixes from fiveruns and 37signals to deal with failover and timeouts #1535 [Joshua Sierles]

* Multibyte: add multibyte-safe Chars#ord rather than falling back to String#ord.  #1483 [Jason Cheow]

* I18n support for Array#to_sentence. Introduces support.array.words_connector, .two_words_connector, and .last_word_connector translation keys.  #1397 [Akira Matsuda]

* Added ActiveSupport::OrderedHash#each_key and ActiveSupport::OrderedHash#each_value #1410 [Christoffer Sawicki]

* TimeWithZone#freeze: preload instance variables so that we can actually freeze [Geoff Buesing]

* Fix Brasilia timezone #1180 [Marcus Derencius, Kane]

* Time#advance recognizes fractional days and weeks. Deprecate Durations of fractional months and years #970 [Tom Lea]

* Add ActiveSupport::Rescuable module abstracting ActionController::Base rescue_from features. [Norbert Crombach, Pratik Naik]

* Switch from String#chars to String#mb_chars for the unicode proxy.  [Manfred Stienstra]

  This helps with 1.8.7 compatibility and also improves performance for some operations by reducing indirection.

* TimeWithZone #wday, #yday and #to_date avoid trip through #method_missing [Geoff Buesing]

* Added Time, Date, DateTime and TimeWithZone #past?, #future? and #today? #720 [Clemens Kofler, Geoff Buesing]

* Added Inflector#parameterize for easy slug generation ("Donald E. Knuth".parameterize => "donald-e-knuth") #713 [Matt Darby]

* Changed cache benchmarking to be reported in milliseconds [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Fix Ruby's Time marshaling bug in pre-1.9 versions of Ruby: utc instances are now correctly unmarshaled with a utc zone instead of the system local zone [#900 state:resolved] [Luca Guidi, Geoff Buesing]

* Add Array#in_groups which splits or iterates over the array in specified number of groups. #579. [Adrian Mugnolo] Example:

  a = (1..10).to_a
  a.in_groups(3)        # => [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, nil], [8, 9, 10, nil]]
  a.in_groups(3, false) # => [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

* Fix TimeWithZone unmarshaling: coerce unmarshaled Time instances to utc, because Ruby's marshaling of Time instances doesn't respect the zone [Geoff Buesing]

* Added Memoizable mixin for caching simple lazy loaded attributes [Josh Peek]

* Move the test related core_ext stuff out of core_ext so it's only loaded by the test helpers.  [Michael Koziarski]

* Add Inflection rules for String#humanize. #535 [Dan Manges]

  ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
    inflect.human(/_cnt$/i, '\1_count')
  end

  'jargon_cnt'.humanize # => 'Jargon count'

* TimeWithZone: when crossing DST boundary, treat Durations of days, months or years as variable-length, and all other values as absolute length. A time + 24.hours will advance exactly 24 hours, but a time + 1.day will advance 23-25 hours, depending on the day. Ensure consistent behavior across all advancing methods [Geoff Buesing]

* Added TimeZone #=~, to support matching zones by regex in time_zone_select. #195 [Ernie Miller]

* Added Array#second through Array#fifth as aliases for Array#[1] through Array#[4] + Array#forty_two as alias for Array[41] [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Fixed Date#end_of_quarter to not blow up on May 31st [#289 state:resolved] (Danger)


*2.1.0 (May 31st, 2008)*

* TimeZone#to_s shows offset as GMT instead of UTC, because GMT will be more familiar to end users (see time zone selects used by Windows OS, google.com and yahoo.com.) Reverts [8370] [Geoff Buesing]

* Hash.from_xml: datetime xml types overflow to Ruby DateTime class when out of range of Time. Adding tests for utc offsets [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone #+ and #- : ensure overflow to DateTime with Numeric arg [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding Date.current, which returns Time.zone.today if config.time_zone is set; otherwise returns Date.today [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone: date part getter methods (#year #mon #day etc) are defined on class; no longer relying on method_missing [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.zone.parse return nil for strings with no date information [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.zone.parse respects offset information in string. Resolves #105. [Scott Fleckenstein, Geoff Buesing]

* Added Ruby 1.8 implementation of Process.daemon

* Duration #since and #ago with no argument (e.g., 5.days.ago) return TimeWithZone when config.time_zone is set. Introducing Time.current, which returns Time.zone.now if config.time_zone is set, otherwise just returns Time.now [Geoff Buesing]

* Time#since behaves correctly when passed a Duration. Closes #11527 [kemiller]

* Add #getutc alias for DateTime#utc [Geoff Buesing]

* Refactor TimeWithZone: don't send #since, #ago, #+, #-, #advance through method_missing [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone respects config.active_support.use_standard_json_time_format [Geoff Buesing]

* Modified ActiveSupport::Callbacks::Callback#call to accept multiple arguments.

* Time #yesterday and #tomorrow behave correctly crossing DST boundary. Closes #7399 [sblackstone]

* TimeWithZone: Adding tests for dst and leap day edge cases when advancing time [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone#method_missing: send to utc to advance with dst correctness, otherwise send to time. Adding tests for time calculations methods [Geoff Buesing]

* Add config.active_support.use_standard_json_time_format setting so that Times and Dates export to ISO 8601 dates.  [Rick Olson]

* TZInfo: Removing unneeded TimezoneProxy class [Geoff Buesing]

* TZInfo: Removing unneeded TimezoneIndexDefinition, since we're not including Indexes::Timezones [Geoff Buesing]

* Removing unnecessary uses_tzinfo helper from tests, given that TZInfo is now bundled [Geoff Buesing]

* Bundling abbreviated version of TZInfo gem 0.3.8: only the classes and zone definitions required to support Rails time zone features are included. If a recent version of the full TZInfo gem is installed, this will take precedence over the bundled version [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone#marshal_load does zone lookup via Time.get_zone, so that tzinfo/Olson identifiers are handled [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.zone= accepts TZInfo::Timezone instances and Olson identifiers; wraps result in TimeZone instance [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone time conversions don't need to be wrapped in TimeOrDateTime, because TZInfo does this internally [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone#usec returns 0 instead of error when DateTime is wrapped [Geoff Buesing]

* Improve documentation. [Ryan Bigg, Jan De Poorter, Cheah Chu Yeow, Xavier Shay, Jack Danger Canty, Emilio Tagua, Xavier Noria,  Sunny Ripert]

* Ensure that TimeWithZone#to_yaml works when passed a YAML::Emitter.  [Rick Olson]

* Ensure correct TimeWithZone#to_date [Geoff Buesing]

* Make TimeWithZone work with tzinfo 0.2.x: use TZInfo::Timezone#zone_identifier alias for #abbreviation, silence warnings on tests. Raise LoadError when TZInfo version is < 0.2 by sniffing for TZInfo::TimeOrDateTime constant. Move all tzinfo-dependent TimeZone tests into uses_tzinfo block [Geoff Buesing]

* Time, DateTime and TimeWithZone #in_time_zone defaults to Time.zone. Removing now unneeded #in_current_time_zone [Geoff Buesing]

* TZInfo caches Timezone instances in its own internal hash cache, so TimeZone::MAPPING doesn't need to cache them as well [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding TimeZone#parse [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding TimeZone#at and DateTime#to_f [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone responds to Ruby 1.9 weekday-named query methods [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone caches TZInfo::TimezonePeriod used for time conversion so that it can be reused, and enforces DST rules correctly when instance is created from a local time [Geoff Buesing]

* Fixed that BufferedLogger should create its own directory if one doesn't already exist #11285 [lotswholetime]

* Fix Numeric time tests broken by DST change by anchoring them to fixed times instead of Time.now. Anchor TimeZone#now DST test to time specified with Time.at instead of Time.local to work around platform differences with Time.local and DST representation [Geoff Buesing]

* Removing unneeded #change_time_zone method from Time, DateTime and TimeWithZone [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeZone #local and #now correctly enforce DST rules [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone instances correctly enforce DST rules. Adding TimeZone#period_for_utc [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding Time#end_of_day, _quarter, _week, and _year.  #9312 [Juanjo Bazan, Tarmo Tänav, BigTitus]

* Adding TimeWithZone#between? [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.=== returns true for TimeWithZone instances [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone #+ and #- behave consistently with numeric arguments regardless of whether wrapped time is a Time or DateTime; consistenty answers false to #acts_like?(:date) [Geoff Buesing]

* Add String#squish and String#squish! to remove consecutive chunks of whitespace.  #11123 [Jordi Bunster, Henrik N]

* Serialize BigDecimals as Floats when using to_yaml. #8746 [Ernesto Jimenez]

* Adding TimeWithZone #to_yaml, #to_datetime, #eql? and method aliases for duck-typing compatibility with Time [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeWithZone #in_time_zone returns +self+ if zone argument is the same as #time_zone [Geoff Buesing]

* Pruning unneeded TimeWithZone#change_time_zone_to_current [Geoff Buesing]

* Time#zone=, #in_time_zone and #change_time_zone accept a Duration [Geoff Buesing]

* Time#in_time_zone handles Time.local instances correctly [Geoff Buesing]

* Pruning unneeded Time#change_time_zone_to_current. Enhanced docs to #change_time_zone to explain the difference between this method and #in_time_zone [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeZone#new method renamed #local; when used with Time.zone, constructor now reads: Time.zone.local() [Geoff Buesing]

* Added Base64.encode64s to encode values in base64 without the newlines. This makes the values immediately usable as URL parameters or memcache keys without further processing [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Remove :nodoc: entries around the ActiveSupport test/unit assertions.  #10946 [dancroak, jamesh]

* Add Time.zone_default accessor for setting the default time zone.  Rails::Configuration.time_zone sets this.  #10982 [Geoff Buesing]

* cache.fetch(key, :force => true) to force a cache miss.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Support retrieving TimeZones with a Duration.  TimeZone[-28800] == TimeZone[-480.minutes].  [Rick Olson]

* TimeWithZone#- added, so that #- can handle a Time or TimeWithZone argument correctly [Geoff Buesing]

* with_timezone test helper renamed with_env_tz, to distinguish between setting ENV['TZ'] and setting Time.zone in tests [Geoff Buesing]

* Time#- coerces TimeWithZone argument to a Time instance so that difference in seconds can be calculated. Closes #10914 [Geoff Buesing, yyyc514]

* Adding UTC zone to TimeZone; TimeWithZone no longer has to fake UTC zone with nil [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.get_zone refactored to private method, given that the encapsulated logic is only useful internally [Geoff Buesing]

* Time.zone uses thread-local variable for thread safety. Adding Time.use_zone, for overriding Time.zone locally inside a block. Removing unneeded Time.zone_reset! [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeZone#to_s uses UTC rather than GMT; reapplying change that was undone in [8679]. #1689 [Cheah Chu Yeow]

* Time.days_in_month defaults to current year if no year is supplied as argument #10799 [Radar], uses Date.gregorian_leap? to determine leap year, and uses constant lookup to determine days in month [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding Time and DateTime #compare_with_coercion, which layers behavior on #<=> so that any combination of Time, DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instances can be chronologically compared [Geoff Buesing]

* TimeZone#now returns an ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone [Geoff Buesing]

* Time #in_current_time_zone and #change_time_zone_to_current return self when Time.zone is nil [Geoff Buesing]

* Remove unneeded #to_datetime_default_s alias for DateTime#to_s, given that we inherit a #to_default_s from Date that does exactly the same thing [Geoff Buesing]

* Refactor Time and DateTime #to_formatted_s: use ternary instead of nested if/else [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding Time and DateTime #formatted_offset, for outputting +HH:MM utc offset strings with cross-platform consistency [Geoff Buesing]

* Adding alternate_utc_string option to TimeZone#formatted_offset. Removing unneeded TimeZone#offset. [Geoff Buesing]

* Introduce ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone, for wrapping Time instances with a TimeZone. Introduce instance methods to Time for creating TimeWithZone instances, and class methods for managing a global time zone. [Geoff Buesing]

* Replace non-dst-aware TimeZone class with dst-aware class from tzinfo_timezone plugin. TimeZone#adjust and #unadjust are no longer available; tzinfo gem must now be present in order to perform time zone calculations, via #local_to_utc and #utc_to_local methods. [Geoff Buesing]

* Extract ActiveSupport::Callbacks from Active Record, test case setup and teardown, and ActionController::Dispatcher.  #10727 [Josh Peek]

* Introducing DateTime #utc, #utc? and #utc_offset, for duck-typing compatibility with Time. Closes #10002 [Geoff Buesing]

* Time#to_json uses Numeric#to_utc_offset_s to output a cross-platform-consistent representation without having to convert to DateTime. References #9750 [Geoff Buesing]

* Refactor number-to-HH:MM-string conversion logic from TimeZone#formatted_offset to a reusable Numeric#to_utc_offset_s method. [Geoff Buesing]

* Continue evolution toward ActiveSupport::TestCase.  #10679 [Josh Peek]

* TestCase: introduce declared setup and teardown callbacks. Pass a list of methods and an optional block to call before setup or after teardown. Setup callbacks are run in the order declared; teardown callbacks are run in reverse.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added ActiveSupport::Gzip.decompress/compress(source) as an easy wrapper for Zlib [Tobias Lütke]

* Hash#to_xml handles symbol values.  #9954 [Assaf]

* Hash#symbolize_keys behaves well with integer keys.  #9890 [PotatoSalad]

* Multibyte: String#slice supports regexp argument.  #9646 [yob]

* object.duplicable? returns true if object.dup is safe. False for nil, true, false, symbols, and numbers; true otherwise.  #9333 [sur]

* BufferedLogger#auto_flushing = N flushes the log every N messages. Buffers with an array instead of string. Disabling auto_flushing still flushes when the buffer hits a maximum size, as a failsafe against memory-gobbling.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Fixed Date#xmlschema for dates outside the range of what can be created with Time #9744 [Geoff Buesing]

* Fixed that La Paz was included in -25200 and -14400 offsets when it should only be in -14400 #9735 [bermi]

* Added support for pluralization with a different starting letter than the singular version (cow/kine) #4929 [norri_b/Josh Susser]

* Demote Hash#to_xml to use XmlSimple#xml_in_string so it can't read files or stdin.  #8453 [candlerb, Jeremy Kemper]

* Backport clean_logger changes to support ruby 1.8.2 [Mislav Marohnić]

* Added proper handling of arrays #8537 [Josh Susser]

  Before:

    Hash.from_xml '<images><image>foo.jpg</image></images>'
    # => {:images => {:image => "foo.jpg"}}

    Hash.from_xml '<images><image>foo.jpg</image><image>bar.jpg</image></images>'
    # => {:images => {:image => ["foo.jpg", "bar.jpg"]}}

  After:
    Hash.from_xml '<images type="array"></images>'
    # => {:images => []}

    Hash.from_xml '<images type="array"><image>foo.jpg</image></images>'
    # => {:images => ["foo.jpg"]}

    Hash.from_xml '<images type="array"><image>foo.jpg</image><image>bar.jpg</image></images>'
    # => {:images => ["foo.jpg", "bar.jpg"]}

* Removed breakpointer and Binding.of_caller in favor of relying on ruby-debug by Kent Sibilev since the breakpointer has been broken since Ruby 1.8.4 and will not be coming back [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Added parsing of file type in Hash.xml_in so you can easily do file uploads with base64 from an API [David Heinemeier Hansson]

    <person>
      <name>David</name>
      <avatar type="file" name="me.jpg" content_type="image/jpg">R0lGODlhkACZAPUAAM5lcfjrtMQCG=\n</avatar>
    </person>

  ...becomes:

    attributes = { :person => { :name => "David", :avatar => #<StringIO> } }
    attributes[:person][:avatar].content_type      # => "image/jpg"
    attributes[:person][:avatar].original_filename # => "me.jpg"
    attributes[:person][:avatar].read # => binary data of the file

  Which is duck-type compatible with the files that you get when doing multipart uploads through HTML.

* Improved multibyte performance by relying less on exception raising #8159 [Blaine]

* Use XSD-compatible type names for Hash#to_xml and make the converters extendable #8047 [Tim Pope]

* Hash#with_indifferent_access now also converts hashes kept in arrays to indifferent access (makes it easier to treat HTML and XML parameters the same) [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Hash#to_xml supports YAML attributes.  #7502 [jonathan]

* Refactor ActiveSupport::JSON to be less obtuse.  Add support for JSON decoding by way of Syck with ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(json_string).  Prevent hash keys that are JavaScript reserved words from being unquoted during encoding.  [Sam Stephenson]

* HashWithIndifferentAccess#to_hash converts to a Hash with String keys and the same default value.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Fix remove_constant to correctly handle constant names of the form "::A::...". References #6720. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed Array#to_xml when it contains a series of hashes (each piece would get its own XML declaration) #6610 [thkarcher/cyu]

* Added Time#to_s(:time) which will just return H:M, like 17:44 [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Add Module#attr_accessor_with_default to initialize value of attribute before setting it. Closes #6538. [Stuart Halloway, Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Add ApplicationController special case to Dependencies. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Don't pad remaining places with in_groups_of if specified padding value is false. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Fix cases where empty xml nodes weren't being translated to nil in Hash.create_from_xml [Rick Olso n]

  <written-on type="date"></written-on> # => { :type => 'date' } # WRONG
  <written-on type="date"></written-on> # => nil # RIGHT

* Tighten rescue clauses.  #5985 [james@grayproductions.net]

* Detect missing_constants calls from removed modules and fail accordingly. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Stop using defined? in Dependencies.qualified_const_defined? since defined? may invoke const_missing. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Dependencies can autoload directories of nested classes. [Jeremy Kemper]
    Example:
      invoice.rb            class Invoice
      invoice/lineitem.rb   class Invoice::Lineitem

* Add Deprecation.silence so that Reloadable does not scold itself. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add debugging logging to Dependencies. Currently can be enabled with Dependencies.log_activity = true; adding to Initializer and documenting is forthcoming. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Replace Reloadable with improvements to the Dependencies mechanism. [Nicholas Seckar]

* DateTime#to_time gives hour/minute/second resolution.  #5747 [jon.evans@pobox.com]

* attr_internal to support namespacing and deprecation. Like attr_* except backed by internally-named instance variable. Set attr_internal_naming_format to change the format from the default '@_%s'. [Jeremy Kemper]
    # def foo()   @foo__rofl      end
    # def foo=(v) @foo__rofl = v  end
    self.attr_internal_naming_format = '@%s__rofl'
    attr_internal :foo

* Raise fully qualified names upon name errors. #5533 [Lars Pind, Nicholas Seckar]

* Add extention to obtain the missing constant from NameError instances. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Thoroughly document inflections.  #5700 [petermichaux@gmail.com]

* Added Module#alias_attribute [Jamis/David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:

    class Content < ActiveRecord::Base
      # has a title attribute
    end

    class Email < ActiveRecord::Base
      alias_attribute :subject, :title
    end

    e = Email.find(1)
    e.title    # => "Superstars"
    e.subject  # => "Superstars"
    e.subject? # => true
    e.subject = "Megastars"
    e.title    # => "Megastars"

* Deprecation: easier to work with warning behavior as procs; default behaviors for each environment so users needn't update env.rb; and testing pleasure with assert_deprecated, assert_not_deprecated. [Jeremy Kemper]
  By default, test prints to $stderr, dev logs, production ignores.
  Provide your own per-environment in e.g. config/environments/development.rb:
    ActiveSupport::Deprecation.behavior = Proc.new { |message| raise message }

* First cut of the Rails Deprecation system.   [Michael Koziarski]

* Strip boolean XML content before checking for 'true' [Rick Olson]

* Customize default BigDecimal formatting. References #5672 [Dave Thomas]

* Correctly convert <foo nil="true"> to nil when using Hash.create_from_xml.  [Rick Olson]

* Optional identity for Enumerable#sum defaults to zero. #5657 [gensym@mac.com]

* Fixed HashWithIndifferentAccess#default #5586 [chris@seagul.co.uk]

* More compatible Hash.create_from_xml. #5523 [nunemaker@gmail.com]

* Added Enumerable#sum for calculating a sum from the elements [David Heinemeier Hansson, jonathan@daikini.com]. Examples:

    [1, 2, 3].sum
    payments.sum { |p| p.price * p.tax_rate }
    payments.sum(&:price)

  This is instead of payments.inject(0) { |sum, p| sum + p.price }

* Correct and clarify Array#to_sentence docs.  #5458 [brad@madriska.com]

* alias_method_chain preserves method punctuation so foo, foo?, and foo! may be chained with the same feature. [Jeremy Kemper]
    Example:
      alias_method_chain :save!, :validation
    is equivalent to
      alias_method :save_without_validation!, :save!
      alias_method :save!, :save_with_validation!

* Enhance Symbol#to_proc so it works with list objects, such as multi-dimensional arrays. Closes #5295 [nov@yo.rim.or.jp].  Example:

    {1 => "one", 2 => "two", 3 => "three"}.sort_by(&:first).map(&:last)
    # => ["one", "two", "three"]

* Added Hash.create_from_xml(string) which will create a hash from a XML string and even typecast if possible [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:

    Hash.create_from_xml <<-EOT
      <note>
        <title>This is a note</title>
        <created-at type="date">2004-10-10</created-at>
      </note>
    EOT

  ...would return:

    { :note => { :title => "This is a note", :created_at => Date.new(2004, 10, 10) } }

* Added Jim Weirich's excellent FlexMock class to vendor (Copyright 2003, 2004 by Jim Weirich (jim@weriichhouse.org)) -- it's not automatically required, though, so require 'flexmock' is still necessary [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Fixed that Module#alias_method_chain should work with both foo? foo! and foo at the same time #4954 [anna@wota.jp]

* to_xml fixes, features, and speedup: introduce :dasherize option that converts updated_at to updated-at if true (the existing default); binary columns get encoding="base64" attribute; nil values get nil="true" attribute to distinguish empty values; add type information for float columns; allow arbitrarily deep :include; include SQL type information as the type attribute.  #4989 [Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>]

* Add OrderedHash#values. [Sam Stephenson]

* Added Array#to_s(:db) that'll produce a comma-separated list of ids [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:

    Purchase.find(:all, :conditions => "product_id IN (#{shops.products.to_s(:db)})"

* Normalize classify's argument to a String so that it plays nice with Symbols. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Strip out leading schema name in classify. References #5139. [Michael Schoen]

* Remove Enumerable#first_match since break(value) handles the use case well enough. [Nicholas Seckar]

  Enumerable#first_match was like detect, but instead of returning the matching element, the yielded value returned. For example:

    user_xml = adapters(:from => User, :to => Xml).first_match do |adapter|
      adapter.adapt @user
    end

  But this is just as easily done with:

    user_xml = adapters(:from => User, :to => Xml).each do
      break adapter.adapt(@user)
    end

* Make Array#in_groups_of just return the grouped collection if a block isn't given. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Don't destroy a HashWithIndifferentAccess if symbolize_keys! or  stringify_keys! is called on it. Closes #5076. [Marcel Molina Jr., guy.naor@famundo.com]

* Document Module::delegate. #5002 [pergesu@gmail.com]

* Replace alias method chaining with Module#alias_method_chain. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Strip out punctuation on predicates or bang methods being aliased with alias_method_chain since target?_without_feature is not a valid method name. Add tests for Module#alias_method_chain. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Replace Ruby's deprecated append_features in favor of included. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Allow default options in with_options to be overridden. Closes #4480. [murphy@cYcnus.de]

* Added Module#alias_method_chain [Jamis Buck]

* Updated to Builder 2.0 [David Heinemeier Hansson]

*1.3.0* (March 27th, 2006)

* When possible, avoid incorrectly obtaining constants from parent modules. Fixes #4221. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add more tests for dependencies; refactor existing cases. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Move Module#parent and Module#as_load_path into core_ext. Add Module#parent. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add CachingTools::HashCaching to simplify the creation of nested, autofilling hashes. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Remove a hack intended to avoid unloading the same class twice, but which would not work anyways. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Update Object.subclasses_of to locate nested classes. This affects Object.remove_subclasses_of in that nested classes will now be unloaded. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Update Object.remove_subclasses_of to use Class.remove_class, reducing duplication. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Fixnum#seconds for consistency, so you can say 5.minutes + 30.seconds instead of 5.minutes + 30 #4389 [François Beausoleil]

* Added option to String#camelize to generate lower-cased camel case by passing in :lower, like "super_man".camelize(:lower) # => "superMan" [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Added Hash#diff to show the difference between two hashes [Chris McGrath]

* Added Time#advance to do precise time time calculations for cases where a month being approximated to 30 days won't do #1860 [Rick Olson]

* Enhance Inflector.underscore to convert '-' into '_' (as the inverse of Inflector.dasherize) [Jamis Buck]

* Switched to_xml to use the xml schema format for datetimes.  This allows the encoding of time zones and should improve operability. [Michael Koziarski]

* Added a note to the documentation for the Date related Numeric extensions to indicate that they're
approximations and shouldn't be used for critical calculations. [Michael Koziarski]

* Added Hash#to_xml and Array#to_xml that makes it much easier to produce XML from basic structures [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Examples:

    { :name => "David", :street_name => "Paulina", :age => 26, :moved_on => Date.new(2005, 11, 15) }.to_xml

  ...returns:

      <person>
        <street-name>Paulina</street-name>
        <name>David</name>
        <age type="integer">26</age>
        <moved-on type="date">2005-11-15</moved-on>
      </person>

* Moved Jim Weirich's wonderful Builder from Action Pack to Active Support (it's simply too useful to be stuck in AP) [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Fixed that Array#to_sentence will return "" on an empty array instead of ", and" #3842, #4031 [rubyonrails@beautifulpixel.com]

* Add Enumerable#group_by for grouping collections based on the result of some
  block. Useful, for example, for grouping records by date.

  ex.

     latest_transcripts.group_by(&:day).each do |day, transcripts|
       p "#{day} -> #{transcripts.map(&:class) * ', '}"
     end
     "2006-03-01 -> Transcript"
     "2006-02-28 -> Transcript"
     "2006-02-27 -> Transcript, Transcript"
     "2006-02-26 -> Transcript, Transcript"

  Add Array#in_groups_of, for iterating over an array in groups of a certain
  size.

  ex.

     %w(1 2 3 4 5 6 7).in_groups_of(3) {|g| p g}
     ["1", "2", "3"]
     ["4", "5", "6"]
     ["7", nil, nil]

  [Marcel Molina Jr., Sam Stephenson]

* Added Kernel#daemonize to turn the current process into a daemon that can be killed with a TERM signal [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Add 'around' methods to Logger,  to make it easy to log before and after messages for a given block as requested in #3809. [Michael Koziarski]  Example:

  logger.around_info("Start rendering component (#{options.inspect}): ",
                     "\n\nEnd of component rendering") { yield }

* Added Time#beginning_of_quarter #3607 [cohen.jeff@gmail.com]

* Fix Object.subclasses_of to only return currently defined objects [Jonathan Viney <jonathan@bluewire.net.nz>]

* Fix constantize to properly handle names beginning with '::'. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Make String#last return the string instead of nil when it is shorter than the limit [Scott Barron].

* Added delegation support to Module that allows multiple delegations at once (unlike Forwardable in the stdlib) [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:

    class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_one :subscription
      delegate :free?, :paying?, :to => :subscription
      delegate :overdue?, :to => "subscription.last_payment"
    end

    account.free?    # => account.subscription.free?
    account.overdue? # => account.subscription.last_payment.overdue?

* Fix Reloadable to handle the case where a class that has been 'removed' has not yet been garbage collected. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Don't allow Reloadable to be included into Modules.

* Remove LoadingModule. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add documentation for Reloadable::Subclasses. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add Reloadable::Subclasses which handles the common case where a base class should not be reloaded, but its subclasses should be. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Further improvements to reloading code [Nicholas Seckar, Trevor Squires]

  - All classes/modules which include Reloadable can define reloadable? for fine grained control of reloading
  - Class.remove_class uses Module#parent to access the parent module
  - Class.remove_class expanded to handle multiple classes in a single call
  - LoadingModule.clear! has been removed as it is no longer required
  - Module#remove_classes_including has been removed in favor of Reloadable.reloadable_classes

* Added reusable reloading support through the inclusion of the Relodable module that all subclasses of ActiveRecord::Base, ActiveRecord::Observer, ActiveController::Base, and ActionMailer::Base automatically gets. This means that these classes will be reloaded by the dispatcher when Dependencies.mechanism = :load. You can make your own models reloadable easily:

    class Setting
      include Reloadable
    end

  Reloading a class is done by removing its constant which will cause it to be loaded again on the next reference. [David Heinemeier Hansson]

* Added auto-loading support for classes in modules, so Conductor::Migration will look for conductor/migration.rb and Conductor::Database::Settings will look for conductor/database/settings.rb [Nicholas Seckar]

* Add Object#instance_exec, like instance_eval but passes its arguments to the block.  (Active Support will not override the Ruby 1.9 implementation of this method.) [Sam Stephenson]

* Add Proc#bind(object) for changing a proc or block's self by returning a Method bound to the given object. Based on why the lucky stiff's "cloaker" method. [Sam Stephenson]

* Fix merge and dup for hashes with indifferent access #3404 [Ken Miller]

* Fix the requires in option_merger_test to unbreak AS tests. [Sam Stephenson]

* Make HashWithIndifferentAccess#update behave like Hash#update by returning the hash. #3419, #3425 [asnem@student.ethz.ch, JanPrill@blauton.de, Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Add ActiveSupport::JSON and Object#to_json for converting Ruby objects to JSON strings. [Sam Stephenson]

* Add Object#with_options for DRYing up multiple calls to methods having shared options. [Sam Stephenson]  Example:

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    # Account routes
    map.with_options(:controller => 'account') do |account|
      account.home   '',       :action => 'dashboard'
      account.signup 'signup', :action => 'new'
      account.logout 'logout', :action => 'logout'
    end
  end

* Introduce Dependencies.warnings_on_first_load setting.  If true, enables warnings on first load of a require_dependency.  Otherwise, loads without warnings.  Disabled (set to false) by default.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Active Support is warnings-safe.  #1792 [Eric Hodel]

* Introduce enable_warnings counterpart to silence_warnings.  Turn warnings on when loading a file for the first time if Dependencies.mechanism == :load.  Common mistakes such as redefined methods will print warnings to stderr.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Add Symbol#to_proc, which allows for, e.g. [:foo, :bar].map(&:to_s). [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Added the following methods [Marcel Molina Jr., Sam Stephenson]:
  * Object#copy_instance_variables_from(object) to copy instance variables from one object to another
  * Object#extended_by to get an instance's included/extended modules
  * Object#extend_with_included_modules_from(object) to extend an instance with the modules from another instance

*1.2.5* (December 13th, 2005)

* Become part of Rails 1.0

*1.2.3* (November 7th, 2005)

* Change Inflector#constantize to use eval instead of const_get. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fix const_missing handler to ignore the trailing '.rb' on files when comparing paths. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Define kernel.rb methods in "class Object" instead of "module Kernel" to work around a Windows peculiarity [Sam Stephenson]

* Fix broken tests caused by incomplete loading of active support. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fix status pluralization bug so status_codes doesn't get pluralized as statuses_code.  #2758 [keithm@infused.org]

* Added Kernel#silence_stderr to silence stderr for the duration of the given block [Sam Stephenson]

* Changed Kernel#` to print a message to stderr (like Unix) instead of raising Errno::ENOENT on Win32 [Sam Stephenson]

* Changed 0.blank? to false rather than true since it violates everyone's expectation of blankness.  #2518, #2705 [rails@jeffcole.net]

* When loading classes using const_missing, raise a NameError if and only if the file we tried to load was not present. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added petabytes and exebytes to numeric extensions #2397 [timct@mac.com]

* Added Time#end_of_month to accompany Time#beginning_of_month #2514 [Jens-Christian Fischer]


*1.2.2* (October 26th, 2005)

* Set Logger.silencer = false to disable Logger#silence.  Useful for debugging fixtures.

* Add title case method to String to do, e.g., 'action_web_service'.titlecase #  => 'Action Web Service'. [Marcel Molina Jr.]


*1.2.1* (October 19th, 2005)

* Classify generated routing code as framework code to avoid appearing in application traces. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Show all framework frames in the framework trace. [Nicholas Seckar]


*1.2.0* (October 16th, 2005)

* Update Exception extension to show the first few framework frames in an application trace. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Exception extension to provide support for clean backtraces. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Updated whiny nil to be more concise and useful. [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Enumerable#first_match [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed that Time#change should also reset usec when also resetting minutes #2459 [ikeda@dream.big.or.jp]

* Fix Logger compatibility for distributions that don't keep Ruby and its standard library in sync.

* Replace '%e' from long and short time formats as Windows does not support it. #2344. [Tom Ward <tom@popdog.net>]

* Added to_s(:db) to Range, so you can get "BETWEEN '2005-12-10' AND '2005-12-12'" from Date.new(2005, 12, 10)..Date.new(2005, 12, 12) (and likewise with Times)

* Moved require_library_or_gem into Kernel. #1992 [Michael Schuerig <michael@schuerig.de>]

* Add :rfc822 as an option for Time#to_s (to get rfc822-formatted times)

* Chain the const_missing hook to any previously existing hook so rails can play nicely with rake

* Clean logger is compatible with both 1.8.2 and 1.8.3 Logger.  #2263 [Michael Schuerig <michael@schuerig.de>]

* Added native, faster implementations of .blank? for the core types #2286 [skae]

* Fixed clean logger to work with Ruby 1.8.3 Logger class #2245

* Fixed memory leak with Active Record classes when Dependencies.mechanism = :load #1704 [Chris McGrath]

* Fixed Inflector.underscore for use with acronyms, so HTML becomes html instead of htm_l #2173 [k@v2studio.com]

* Fixed dependencies related infinite recursion bug when a controller file does not contain a controller class. Closes #1760. [rcolli2@tampabay.rr.com]

* Fixed inflections for status, quiz, move #2056 [deirdre@deirdre.net]

* Added Hash#reverse_merge, Hash#reverse_merge!, and Hash#reverse_update to ease the use of default options

* Added Array#to_sentence that'll turn ['one', 'two', 'three'] into "one, two, and three" #2157 [Manfred Stienstra]

* Added Kernel#silence_warnings to turn off warnings temporarily for the passed block

* Added String#starts_with? and String#ends_with? #2118 [Thijs van der Vossen]

* Added easy extendability to the inflector through Inflector.inflections (using the Inflector::Inflections singleton class). Examples:

    Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
      inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1\2en'
      inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'

      inflect.irregular 'octopus', 'octopi'

      inflect.uncountable "equipment"
    end

* Added String#at, String#from, String#to, String#first, String#last in ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::String::Access to ease access to individual characters and substrings in a string serving basically as human names for range access.

* Make Time#last_month work when invoked on the 31st of a month.

* Add Time.days_in_month, and make Time#next_month work when invoked on the 31st of a month

* Fixed that Time#midnight would have a non-zero usec on some platforms #1836

* Fixed inflections of "index/indices" #1766 [damn_pepe@gmail.com]

* Factor Fixnum and Bignum extensions into Integer extensions [Nicholas Seckar]

* Hooked #ordinalize into Fixnum and Bignum classes. [Nicholas Seckar, danp]

* Added Fixnum#ordinalize to turn 1.ordinalize to "1st", 3.ordinalize to "3rd", and 10.ordinalize to "10th" and so on #1724 [paul@cnt.org]


*1.1.1* (11 July, 2005)

* Added more efficient implementation of the development mode reset of classes #1638 [Chris McGrath]


*1.1.0* (6 July, 2005)

* Fixed conflict with Glue gem #1606 [Rick Olson]

* Added new rules to the Inflector to deal with more unusual plurals mouse/louse => mice/lice, information => information, ox => oxen, virus => viri, archive => archives #1571, #1583, #1490, #1599, #1608 [foamdino@gmail.com/others]

* Fixed memory leak with Object#remove_subclasses_of, which inflicted a Rails application running in development mode with a ~20KB leak per request #1289 [Chris McGrath]

* Made 1.year == 365.25.days to account for leap years.  This allows you to do User.find(:all, :conditions => ['birthday > ?', 50.years.ago]) without losing a lot of days.  #1488 [tuxie@dekadance.se]

* Added an exception if calling id on nil to WhinyNil #584 [kevin-temp@writesoon.com]

* Added Fix/Bignum#multiple_of? which returns true on 14.multiple_of?(7) and false on 16.multiple_of?(7) #1464 [Thomas Fuchs]

* Added even? and odd? to work with Bignums in addition to Fixnums #1464 [Thomas Fuchs]

* Fixed Time#at_beginning_of_week returned the next Monday instead of the previous one when called on a Sunday #1403 [jean.helou@gmail.com]

* Increased the speed of indifferent hash access by using Hash#default.  #1436 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added that "   " is now also blank? (using strip if available)

* Fixed Dependencies so all modules are able to load missing constants #1173 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed the Inflector to underscore strings containing numbers, so Area51Controller becomes area51_controller #1176 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed that HashWithIndifferentAccess stringified all keys including symbols, ints, objects, and arrays #1162 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed Time#last_year to go back in time, not forward #1278 [fabien@odilat.com]

* Fixed the pluralization of analysis to analyses #1295 [seattle@rootimage.msu.edu]

* Fixed that Time.local(2005,12).months_since(1) would raise "ArgumentError: argument out of range" #1311 [jhahn@niveon.com]

* Added silencing to the default Logger class


*1.0.4* (19th April, 2005)

* Fixed that in some circumstances controllers outside of modules may have hidden ones inside modules. For example, admin/content might have been hidden by /content. #1075 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Fixed inflection of perspectives and similar words #1045 [Thijs van der Vossen]

* Added Fixnum#even? and Fixnum#odd?

* Fixed problem with classes being required twice. Object#const_missing now uses require_dependency to load files. It used to use require_or_load which would cause models to be loaded twice, which was not good for validations and other class methods #971 [Nicholas Seckar]


*1.0.3* (27th March, 2005)

* Fixed Inflector.pluralize to handle capitalized words #932 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Object#suppress which allows you to make a saner choice around with exceptions to swallow #980. Example:

    suppress(ZeroDivisionError) { 1/0 }

  ...instead of:

    1/0 rescue nil # BAD, EVIL, DIRTY.


*1.0.2* (22th March, 2005)

* Added Kernel#returning -- a Ruby-ized realization of the K combinator, courtesy of Mikael Brockman.

    def foo
      returning values = [] do
        values << 'bar'
        values << 'baz'
      end
    end

    foo # => ['bar', 'baz']


*1.0.1* (7th March, 2005)

* Fixed Hash#indifferent_access to also deal with include? and fetch and nested hashes #726 [Nicholas Seckar]

* Added Object#blank? -- see http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/objectBlank.html #783 [_why the lucky stiff]

* Added inflection rules for "sh" words, like "wish" and "fish" #755 [phillip@pjbsoftware.com]

* Fixed an exception when using Ajax based requests from Safari because Safari appends a \000 to the post body. Symbols can't have \000 in them so indifferent access would throw an exception in the constructor. Indifferent hashes now use strings internally instead. #746 [Tobias Lütke]

* Added String#to_time and String#to_date for wrapping ParseDate


*1.0.0* (24th February, 2005)

* Added TimeZone as the first of a number of value objects that among others Active Record can use rich value objects using composed_of #688 [Jamis Buck]

* Added Date::Conversions for getting dates in different convenient string representations and other objects

* Added Time::Conversions for getting times in different convenient string representations and other objects

* Added Time::Calculations to ask for things like Time.now.tomorrow, Time.now.yesterday, Time.now.months_ago(4) #580 [DP|Flurin]. Examples:

    "Later today"         => now.in(3.hours),
    "Tomorrow morning"    => now.tomorrow.change(:hour => 9),
    "Tomorrow afternoon"  => now.tomorrow.change(:hour => 14),
    "In a couple of days" => now.tomorrow.tomorrow.change(:hour => 9),
    "Next monday"         => now.next_week.change(:hour => 9),
    "In a month"          => now.next_month.change(:hour => 9),
    "In 6 months"         => now.months_since(6).change(:hour => 9),
    "In a year"           => now.in(1.year).change(:hour => 9)

* Upgraded to breakpoint 92 which fixes:

    * overload IRB.parse_opts(), fixes #443
      => breakpoints in tests work even when running them via rake
    * untaint handlers, might fix an issue discussed on the Rails ML
    * added verbose mode to breakpoint_client
    * less noise caused by breakpoint_client by default
    * ignored TerminateLineInput exception in signal handler
      => quiet exit on Ctrl-C

* Fixed Inflector for words like "news" and "series" that are the same in plural and singular #603 [echion], #615 [marcenuc]

* Added Hash#stringify_keys and Hash#stringify_keys!

* Added IndifferentAccess as a way to wrap a hash by a symbol-based store that also can be accessed by string keys

* Added Inflector.constantize to turn "Admin::User" into a reference for the constant Admin::User

* Added that Inflector.camelize and Inflector.underscore can deal with modules like turning "Admin::User" into "admin/user" and back

* Added Inflector.humanize to turn attribute names like employee_salary into "Employee salary". Used by automated error reporting in AR.

* Added availability of class inheritable attributes to the masses #477 [Jeremy Kemper]

    class Foo
      class_inheritable_reader :read_me
      class_inheritable_writer :write_me
      class_inheritable_accessor :read_and_write_me
      class_inheritable_array :read_and_concat_me
      class_inheritable_hash :read_and_update_me
    end

    # Bar gets a clone of (not a reference to) Foo's attributes.
    class Bar < Foo
    end

    Bar.read_and_write_me == Foo.read_and_write_me
    Bar.read_and_write_me = 'bar'
    Bar.read_and_write_me != Foo.read_and_write_me

* Added Inflections as an extension on String, so Inflector.pluralize(Inflector.classify(name)) becomes name.classify.pluralize #476 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added Byte operations to Numeric, so 5.5.megabytes + 200.kilobytes #461 [Marcel Molina Jr.]

* Fixed that Dependencies.reload can't load the same file twice #420 [Kent Sibilev]

* Added Fixnum#ago/until, Fixnum#since/from_now #450 [Jeremy Kemper]

* Added that Inflector now accepts Symbols and Classes by calling .to_s on the word supplied

* Added time unit extensions to Fixnum that'll return the period in seconds, like 2.days + 4.hours.
