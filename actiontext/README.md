# Action Text

Action Text brings rich text content and editing to \Rails. It includes the [Trix editor](https://trix-editor.org) that handles everything from formatting to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries. The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own RichText model that's associated with any existing Active Record model in the application. Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model.

You can read more about Action Text in the [Action Text Overview](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html) guide.

## Development

The JavaScript for Action Text is distributed both as a npm module under @rails/actiontext and via the asset pipeline as actiontext.js (and we mirror Trix as trix.js). To ensure that the latter remains in sync, you must run `yarn build` and checkin the artifacts whenever the JavaScript source or the Trix dependency is bumped. CSS changes must be brought over manually to app/assets/stylesheets/trix.css
