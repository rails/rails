Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce that Rails <%= versions.join(" and ") %> <%= versions.size > 1 ? "have" : "has" %> been released.

<% if future_date %>
If no regressions are found, expect the final release on <%= future_date.strftime("%A, %B %-d, %Y") %>.
If you find one, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new)
<%= "and mention me (@#{github_user}) on it, " unless github_user.empty? %>so that we can fix it before the final release.
<% end %>
<% versions.each do |version| %>

## CHANGES since <%= version.previous %>

<%= fetch_changes(version) %>

### Full listing

To see the full list of changes, [check out all the commits on
GitHub](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v<%= "#{version.previous}...v#{version}" %>).
<% end %>

## SHA-256

If you'd like to verify that your gem is the same as the one I've uploaded,
please use these SHA-256 hashes.

<% versions.each do |version| %>
Here are the checksums for <%= version %>:

```
$ shasum -a 256 *-<%= version %>.gem
<%= `shasum -a 256 *-#{version}.gem` %>
```

<% end %>
As always, huge thanks to the many contributors who helped with this release.
