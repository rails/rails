    # = Active Record \Transactions
    #
    # \Transactions are protective blocks where SQL statements are only permanent
    # if they can all succeed as one atomic action. The classic example is a
    # transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the
    # withdrawal succeeded and vice versa. \Transactions enforce the integrity of
    # the database and guard the data against program errors or database
    # break-downs. So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you
    # have a number of statements that must be executed together or not at all.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    #     david.withdrawal(100)
    #     mary.deposit(100)
    #   end
    #
    # This example will only take money from David and give it to Mary if neither
    # +withdrawal+ nor +deposit+ raise an exception. Exceptions will force a
    # ROLLBACK that returns the database to the state before the transaction
    # began. Be aware, though, that the objects will _not_ have their instance
    # data returned to their pre-transactional state.
    #
    # == Different Active Record classes in a single transaction
    #
    # Though the #transaction class method is called on some Active Record class,
    # the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of
    # that class. This is because transactions are per-database connection, not
    # per-model.
    #
    # In this example a +balance+ record is transactionally saved even
    # though #transaction is called on the +Account+ class:
    #
    #   Account.transaction do
    #     balance.save!
    #     account.save!
    #   end
    #
    # The #transaction method is also available as a model instance method.
    # For example, you can also do this:
    #
    #   balance.transaction do
    #     balance.save!
    #     account.save!
    #   end
    #
    # == Transactions are not distributed across database connections
    #
    # A transaction acts on a single database connection. If you have
    # multiple class-specific databases, the transaction will not protect
    # interaction among them. One workaround is to begin a transaction
    # on each class whose models you alter:
    #
    #   Student.transaction do
    #     Course.transaction do
    #       course.enroll(student)
    #       student.units += course.units
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This is a poor solution, but fully distributed transactions are beyond
    # the scope of Active Record.
    #
    # == +save+ and +destroy+ are automatically wrapped in a transaction
    #
    # Both {#save}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save] and
    # {#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] come wrapped in a transaction that ensures
    # that whatever you do in validations or callbacks will happen under its
    # protected cover. So you can use validations to check for values that
    # the transaction depends on or you can raise exceptions in the callbacks
    # to rollback, including <tt>after_*</tt> callbacks.
    #
    # As a consequence changes to the database are not seen outside your connection
    # until the operation is complete. For example, if you try to update the index
    # of a search engine in +after_save+ the indexer won't see the updated record.
    # The #after_commit callback is the only one that is triggered once the update
    # is committed. See below.
    #
    # == Exception handling and rolling back
    #
    # Also have in mind that exceptions thrown within a transaction block will
    # be propagated (after triggering the ROLLBACK), so you should be ready to
    # catch those in your application code.
    #
    # One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will trigger
    # a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block. Any
    # other exception will be re-raised.
    #
    # *Warning*: one should not catch ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exceptions
    # inside a transaction block. ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exceptions indicate that an
    # error occurred at the database level, for example when a unique constraint
    # is violated. On some database systems, such as PostgreSQL, database errors
    # inside a transaction cause the entire transaction to become unusable
    # until it's restarted from the beginning. Here is an example which
    # demonstrates the problem:
    #
    #   # Suppose that we have a Number model with a unique column called 'i'.
    #   Number.transaction do
    #     Number.create(i: 0)
    #     begin
    #       # This will raise a unique constraint error...
    #       Number.create(i: 0)
    #     rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
    #       # ...which we ignore.
    #     end
    #
    #     # On PostgreSQL, the transaction is now unusable. The following
    #     # statement will cause a PostgreSQL error, even though the unique
    #     # constraint is no longer violated:
    #     Number.create(i: 1)
    #     # => "PG::Error: ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands
    #     #     ignored until end of transaction block"
    #   end
    #
    # One should restart the entire transaction if an
    # ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid occurred.
    #
    # == Nested transactions
    #
    # #transaction calls can be nested. By default, this makes all database
    # statements in the nested transaction block become part of the parent
    # transaction. For example, the following behavior may be surprising:
    #
    #   User.transaction do
    #     User.create(username: 'Kotori')
    #     User.transaction do
    #       User.create(username: 'Nemu')
    #       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # creates both "Kotori" and "Nemu". Reason is the ActiveRecord::Rollback
    # exception in the nested block does not issue a ROLLBACK. Since these exceptions
    # are captured in transaction blocks, the parent block does not see it and the
    # real transaction is committed.
    #
    # In order to get a ROLLBACK for the nested transaction you may ask for a real
    # sub-transaction by passing <tt>requires_new: true</tt>. If anything goes wrong,
    # the database rolls back to the beginning of the sub-transaction without rolling
    # back the parent transaction. If we add it to the previous example:
    #
    #   User.transaction do
    #     User.create(username: 'Kotori')
    #     User.transaction(requires_new: true) do
    #       User.create(username: 'Nemu')
    #       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # only "Kotori" is created.
    #
    # Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
    # writing, the only database that we're aware of that supports true nested
    # transactions, is MS-SQL. Because of this, Active Record emulates nested
    # transactions by using savepoints. See
    # https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/savepoint.html
    # for more information about savepoints.
    #
    # === \Callbacks
    #
    # There are two types of callbacks associated with committing and rolling back transactions:
    # #after_commit and #after_rollback.
    #
    # #after_commit callbacks are called on every record saved or destroyed within a
    # transaction immediately after the transaction is committed. #after_rollback callbacks
    # are called on every record saved or destroyed within a transaction immediately after the
    # transaction or savepoint is rolled back.
    #
    # These callbacks are useful for interacting with other systems since you will be guaranteed
    # that the callback is only executed when the database is in a permanent state. For example,
    # #after_commit is a good spot to put in a hook to clearing a cache since clearing it from
    # within a transaction could trigger the cache to be regenerated before the database is updated.
    #
    # ==== NOTE: Callbacks are deduplicated per callback by filter.
    #
    # Trying to define multiple callbacks with the same filter will result in a single callback being run.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   after_commit :do_something
    #   after_commit :do_something # only the last one will be called
    #
    # This applies to all variations of <tt>after_*_commit</tt> callbacks as well.
    #
    #   after_commit :do_something
    #   after_create_commit :do_something
    #   after_save_commit :do_something
    #
    # It is recommended to use the +on:+ option to specify when the callback should be run.
    #
    #   after_commit :do_something, on: [:create, :update]
    #
    # This is equivalent to using +after_create_commit+ and +after_update_commit+, but will not be deduplicated.
    #
    # === Caveats
    #
    # If you're on MySQL, then do not use Data Definition Language (DDL) operations in nested
    # transactions blocks that are emulated with savepoints. That is, do not execute statements
    # like 'CREATE TABLE' inside such blocks. This is because MySQL automatically
    # releases all savepoints upon executing a DDL operation. When +transaction+
    # is finished and tries to release the savepoint it created earlier, a
    # database error will occur because the savepoint has already been
    # automatically released. The following example demonstrates the problem:
    #
    #   Model.lease_connection.transaction do                           # BEGIN
    #     Model.lease_connection.transaction(requires_new: true) do     # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
    #       Model.lease_connection.create_table(...)                    # active_record_1 now automatically released
    #     end                                                     # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
    #                                                             # ^^^^ BOOM! database error!
    #   end
    #
    # Note that "TRUNCATE" is also a MySQL DDL statement!
