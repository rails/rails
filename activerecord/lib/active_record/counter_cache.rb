      # Resets one or more counter caches to their correct value using an SQL
      # count query. This is useful when adding new counter caches, or if the
      # counter has been corrupted or modified directly by SQL.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +id+ - The id of the object you wish to reset a counter on or an array of ids.
      # * +counters+ - One or more association counters to reset. Association name or counter name can be given.
      # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
      #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
      #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # For the Post with id #1, reset the comments_count
      #   Post.reset_counters(1, :comments)

      #   # For posts with ids #1 and #2, reset the comments_count
      #   Post.reset_counters([1, 2], :comments)

      # A generic "counter updater" implementation, intended primarily to be
      # used by #increment_counter and #decrement_counter, but which may also
      # be useful on its own. It simply does a direct SQL update for the record
      # with the given ID, altering the given hash of counters by the amount
      # given by the corresponding value:
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +id+ - The id of the object you wish to update a counter on or an array of ids.
      # * +counters+ - A Hash containing the names of the fields
      #   to update as keys and the amount to update the field by as values.
      # * <tt>:touch</tt> option - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
      #   If attribute names are passed, they are updated along with updated_at/on
      #   attributes.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # For the Post with id of 5, decrement the comments_count by 1, and
      #   # increment the actions_count by 1
      #   Post.update_counters 5, comments_count: -1, actions_count: 1
      #   # Executes the following SQL:
      #   # UPDATE posts
      #   #    SET comments_count = COALESCE(comments_count, 0) - 1,
      #   #        actions_count = COALESCE(actions_count, 0) + 1
      #   #  WHERE id = 5
      #
      #   # For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comments_count by 1
      #   Post.update_counters [10, 15], comments_count: 1
      #   # Executes the following SQL:
      #   # UPDATE posts
      #   #    SET comments_count = COALESCE(comments_count, 0) + 1
      #   #  WHERE id IN (10, 15)
      #
      #   # For the Posts with id of 10 and 15, increment the comments_count by 1
      #   # and update the updated_at value for each counter.
      #   Post.update_counters [10, 15], comments_count: 1, touch: true
      #   # Executes the following SQL:
      #   # UPDATE posts
      #   #    SET comments_count = COALESCE(comments_count, 0) + 1,
      #   #    `updated_at` = '2016-10-13T09:59:23-05:00'
      #   #  WHERE id IN (10, 15)

      end

      # Increment a numeric field by one, via a direct SQL update.
      #
      # This method is used primarily for maintaining counter_cache columns that are
      # used to store aggregate values. For example, a +DiscussionBoard+ may cache
      # posts_count and comments_count to avoid running an SQL query to calculate the
      # number of posts and comments there are, each time it is displayed.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be incremented.
      # * +id+ - The id of the object that should be incremented or an array of ids.
      # * <tt>:by</tt> - The amount by which to increment the value. Defaults to +1+.
      # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
      #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
      #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # Increment the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
      #   DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:posts_count, 5)
      #
      #   # Increment the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
      #   # by a specific amount.
      #   DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:posts_count, 5, by: 3)
      #
      #   # Increment the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
      #   # and update the updated_at value.
      #   DiscussionBoard.increment_counter(:posts_count, 5, touch: true)
      def increment_counter(counter_name, id, by: 1, touch: nil)
        update_counters(id, counter_name => by, touch: touch)
      end

      # Decrement a numeric field by one, via a direct SQL update.
      #
      # This works the same as #increment_counter but reduces the column value by
      # 1 instead of increasing it.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      #
      # * +counter_name+ - The name of the field that should be decremented.
      # * +id+ - The id of the object that should be decremented or an array of ids.
      # * <tt>:by</tt> - The amount by which to decrement the value. Defaults to +1+.
      # * <tt>:touch</tt> - Touch timestamp columns when updating.
      #   Pass +true+ to touch +updated_at+ and/or +updated_on+. Pass a symbol to
      #   touch that column or an array of symbols to touch just those ones.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # Decrement the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
      #   DiscussionBoard.decrement_counter(:posts_count, 5)
      #
      #   # Decrement the posts_count column for the record with an id of 5
      #   by a specific amount.
