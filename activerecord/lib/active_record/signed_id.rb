      # Lets you find a record based on a signed id that's safe to put into the world without risk of tampering.
      # This is particularly useful for things like password reset or email verification, where you want
      # the bearer of the signed id to be able to interact with the underlying record, but usually only within
      # a certain time period.
      #
      # You set the time period that the signed id is valid for during generation, using the instance method
      # <tt>signed_id(expires_in: 15.minutes)</tt>. If the time has elapsed before a signed find is attempted,
      # the signed id will no longer be valid, and nil is returned.
      #
      # It's possible to further restrict the use of a signed id with a purpose. This helps when you have a
      # general base model, like a User, which might have signed ids for several things, like password reset
      # or email verification. The purpose that was set during generation must match the purpose set when
      # finding. If there's a mismatch, nil is again returned.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   signed_id = User.first.signed_id expires_in: 15.minutes, purpose: :password_reset
      #
      #   User.find_signed signed_id # => nil, since the purpose does not match
      #
      #   travel 16.minutes
      #   User.find_signed signed_id, purpose: :password_reset # => nil, since the signed id has expired
      #
      #   travel_back
      #   User.find_signed signed_id, purpose: :password_reset # => User.first

      # Works like find_signed, but will raise an +ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature+

    # This signed id is tamper proof, so it's safe to send in an email or otherwise share with the outside world.
    # However, as with any message signed with a +ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier+,
    # {the signed id is not encrypted}[link:classes/ActiveSupport/MessageVerifier.html#class-ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier-label-Signing+is+not+encryption].
    # It's just encoded and protected against tampering.
    #
    # This means that the ID can be decoded by anyone; however, if tampered with (so to point to a different ID),
    # the cryptographic signature will no longer match, and the signed id will be considered invalid and return nil
    # when passed to +find_signed+ (or raise with +find_signed!+).
    #
    # It can furthermore be set to expire (the default is not to expire), and scoped down with a specific purpose.
    # If the expiration date has been exceeded before +find_signed+ is called, the id won't find the designated
    # record. If a purpose is set, this too must match.
    #
    # If you accidentally let a signed id out in the wild that you wish to retract sooner than its expiration date
    # (or maybe you forgot to set an expiration date while meaning to!), you can use the purpose to essentially
    # version the signed_id, like so:
    #
    #   user.signed_id purpose: :v2

    # created with the purpose will no longer find the record.
