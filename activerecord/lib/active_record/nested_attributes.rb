    # = Active Record Nested \Attributes
    #
    # Nested attributes allow you to save attributes on associated records
    # through the parent. By default nested attribute updating is turned off
    # and you can enable it using the accepts_nested_attributes_for class
    # method. When you enable nested attributes an attribute writer is
    # defined on the model.
    #
    # The attribute writer is named after the association, which means that
    # in the following example, two new methods are added to your model:
    #
    # <tt>author_attributes=(attributes)</tt> and
    # <tt>pages_attributes=(attributes)</tt>.
    #
    #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :author
    #     has_many :pages
    #
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
    #   end
    #
    # Note that the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is automatically enabled on every
    # association that accepts_nested_attributes_for is used for.
    #
    # === One-to-one
    #
    # Consider a Member model that has one Avatar:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
    #   end
    #
    # Enabling nested attributes on a one-to-one association allows you to
    # create the member and avatar in one go:
    #
    #   params = { member: { name: 'Jack', avatar_attributes: { icon: 'smiling' } } }
    #   member = Member.create(params[:member])
    #   member.avatar.id # => 2
    #   member.avatar.icon # => 'smiling'
    #
    # It also allows you to update the avatar through the member:
    #
    #   params = { member: { avatar_attributes: { id: '2', icon: 'sad' } } }
    #   member.update params[:member]
    #   member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'
    #
    # If you want to update the current avatar without providing the id, you must add <tt>:update_only</tt> option.
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, update_only: true
    #   end
    #
    #   params = { member: { avatar_attributes: { icon: 'sad' } } }
    #   member.update params[:member]
    #   member.avatar.id # => 2
    #   member.avatar.icon # => 'sad'
    #
    # By default you will only be able to set and update attributes on the
    # associated model. If you want to destroy the associated model through the
    # attributes hash, you have to enable it first using the
    # <tt>:allow_destroy</tt> option.
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, allow_destroy: true
    #   end
    #
    # Now, when you add the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to the attributes hash, with a
    # value that evaluates to +true+, you will destroy the associated model:
    #
    #   member.avatar_attributes = { id: '2', _destroy: '1' }
    #   member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # => true
    #   member.save
    #   member.reload.avatar # => nil
    #
    # Note that the model will _not_ be destroyed until the parent is saved.
    #
    # Also note that the model will not be destroyed unless you also specify
    # its id in the updated hash.
    #
    # === One-to-many
    #
    # Consider a member that has a number of posts:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts
    #   end
    #
    # You can now set or update attributes on the associated posts through
    # an attribute hash for a member: include the key +:posts_attributes+
    # with an array of hashes of post attributes as a value.
    #
    # For each hash that does _not_ have an <tt>id</tt> key a new record will
    # be instantiated, unless the hash also contains a <tt>_destroy</tt> key
    # that evaluates to +true+.
    #
    #   params = { member: {
    #     name: 'joe', posts_attributes: [
    #       { title: 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { title: 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
    #       { title: '', _destroy: '1' } # this will be ignored
    #     ]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member = Member.create(params[:member])
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
    #
    # You may also set a +:reject_if+ proc to silently ignore any new record
    # hashes if they fail to pass your criteria. For example, the previous
    # example could be rewritten as:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: proc { |attributes| attributes['title'].blank? }
    #   end
    #
    #   params = { member: {
    #     name: 'joe', posts_attributes: [
    #       { title: 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { title: 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen' },
    #       { title: '' } # this will be ignored because of the :reject_if proc
    #     ]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member = Member.create(params[:member])
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.posts.first.title # => 'Kari, the awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => 'The egalitarian assumption of the modern citizen'
    #
    # Alternatively, +:reject_if+ also accepts a symbol for using methods:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :new_record?
    #   end
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, reject_if: :reject_posts
    #
    #     def reject_posts(attributes)
    #       attributes['title'].blank?
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the hash contains an <tt>id</tt> key that matches an already
    # associated record, the matching record will be modified:
    #
    #   member.attributes = {
    #     name: 'Joe',
    #     posts_attributes: [
    #       { id: 1, title: '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!' },
    #       { id: 2, title: '[UPDATED] other post' }
    #     ]
    #   }
    #
    #   member.posts.first.title # => '[UPDATED] An, as of yet, undisclosed awesome Ruby documentation browser!'
    #   member.posts.second.title # => '[UPDATED] other post'
    #
    # However, the above applies if the parent model is being updated as well.
    # For example, if you wanted to create a +member+ named _joe_ and wanted to
    # update the +posts+ at the same time, that would give an
    # ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error.
    #
    # By default the associated records are protected from being destroyed. If
    # you want to destroy any of the associated records through the attributes
    # hash, you have to enable it first using the <tt>:allow_destroy</tt>
    # option. This will allow you to also use the <tt>_destroy</tt> key to
    # destroy existing records:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :posts, allow_destroy: true
    #   end
    #
    #   params = { member: {
    #     posts_attributes: [{ id: '2', _destroy: '1' }]
    #   }}
    #
    #   member.attributes = params[:member]
    #   member.posts.detect { |p| p.id == 2 }.marked_for_destruction? # => true
    #   member.posts.length # => 2
    #   member.save
    #   member.reload.posts.length # => 1
    #
    # Nested attributes for an associated collection can also be passed in
    # the form of a hash of hashes instead of an array of hashes:
    #
    #   Member.create(
    #     name: 'joe',
    #     posts_attributes: {
    #       first:  { title: 'Foo' },
    #       second: { title: 'Bar' }
    #     }
    #   )
    #
    # has the same effect as
    #
    #   Member.create(
    #     name: 'joe',
    #     posts_attributes: [
    #       { title: 'Foo' },
    #       { title: 'Bar' }
    #     ]
    #   )
    #
    # The keys of the hash which is the value for +:posts_attributes+ are
    # ignored in this case.
    # However, it is not allowed to use <tt>'id'</tt> or <tt>:id</tt> for one of
    # such keys, otherwise the hash will be wrapped in an array and
    # interpreted as an attribute hash for a single post.
    #
    # Passing attributes for an associated collection in the form of a hash
    # of hashes can be used with hashes generated from HTTP/HTML parameters,
    # where there may be no natural way to submit an array of hashes.
    #
    # === Saving
    #
    # All changes to models, including the destruction of those marked for
    # destruction, are saved and destroyed automatically and atomically when
    # the parent model is saved. This happens inside the transaction initiated
    # by the parent's save method. See ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation.
    #
    # === Validating the presence of a parent model
    #
    # The +belongs_to+ association validates the presence of the parent model
    # by default. You can disable this behavior by specifying <code>optional: true</code>.
    # This can be used, for example, when conditionally validating the presence
    # of the parent model:
    #
    #   class Veterinarian < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :patients, inverse_of: :veterinarian
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :patients
    #   end
    #
    #   class Patient < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :veterinarian, inverse_of: :patients, optional: true
    #     validates :veterinarian, presence: true, unless: -> { awaiting_intake }
    #   end
    #
    # Note that if you do not specify the +:inverse_of+ option, then
    # Active Record will try to automatically guess the inverse association
    # based on heuristics.
    #
    # For one-to-one nested associations, if you build the new (in-memory)
    # child object yourself before assignment, then this module will not
    # overwrite it, e.g.:
    #
    #   class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :avatar
    #     accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar
    #
    #     def avatar
    #       super || build_avatar(width: 200)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   member = Member.new
    #   member.avatar_attributes = {icon: 'sad'}
    #   member.avatar.width # => 200
    #
    # === Creating forms with nested attributes
    #
    # Use ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper#fields_for to create form elements for
    # nested attributes.
    #
    # Integration test params should reflect the structure of the form. For
    # example:
    #
    #   post members_path, params: {
    #     member: {
    #       name: 'joe',
    #       posts_attributes: {
    #         '0' => { title: 'Foo' },
    #         '1' => { title: 'Bar' }
    #       }
    #     }
    #   }
    module ClassMethods
      REJECT_ALL_BLANK_PROC = proc { |attributes| attributes.all? { |key, value| key == "_destroy" || value.blank? } }

      # Defines an attributes writer for the specified association(s).
      #
      # Supported options:
      # [:allow_destroy]
      #   If true, destroys any members from the attributes hash with a
      #   <tt>_destroy</tt> key and a value that evaluates to +true+
      #   (e.g. 1, '1', true, or 'true'). This option is false by default.
      # [:reject_if]
      #   Allows you to specify a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method
      #   that checks whether a record should be built for a certain attribute
      #   hash. The hash is passed to the supplied Proc or the method
      #   and it should return either +true+ or +false+. When no +:reject_if+
      #   is specified, a record will be built for all attribute hashes that
      #   do not have a <tt>_destroy</tt> value that evaluates to true.
      #   Passing <tt>:all_blank</tt> instead of a Proc will create a proc
      #   that will reject a record where all the attributes are blank excluding
      #   any value for +_destroy+.
      # [:limit]
      #   Allows you to specify the maximum number of associated records that
      #   can be processed with the nested attributes. Limit also can be specified
      #   as a Proc or a Symbol pointing to a method that should return a number.
      #   If the size of the nested attributes array exceeds the specified limit,
      #   NestedAttributes::TooManyRecords exception is raised. If omitted, any
      #   number of associations can be processed.
      #   Note that the +:limit+ option is only applicable to one-to-many
      #   associations.
      # [:update_only]
      #   For a one-to-one association, this option allows you to specify how
      #   nested attributes are going to be used when an associated record already
      #   exists. In general, an existing record may either be updated with the
      #   new set of attribute values or be replaced by a wholly new record
      #   containing those values. By default the +:update_only+ option is false
      #   and the nested attributes are used to update the existing record only
      #   if they include the record's <tt>:id</tt> value. Otherwise a new
      #   record will be instantiated and used to replace the existing one.
      #   However if the +:update_only+ option is true, the nested attributes
      #   are used to update the record's attributes always, regardless of
      #   whether the <tt>:id</tt> is present. The option is ignored for collection
      #   associations.
      #
      # Examples:
      #   # creates avatar_attributes=
      #   accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, reject_if: proc { |attributes| attributes['name'].blank? }
      #   # creates avatar_attributes=
      #   accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, reject_if: :all_blank
      #   # creates avatar_attributes= and posts_attributes=
