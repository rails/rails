# Fixtures are a way of organizing data that you want to test against; in short, sample data. They come in 3 flavours:
#
#   1.  YAML fixtures
#   2.  CSV fixtures
#   3.  Single-file fixtures
#
# = YAML fixtures
#
# This type of fixture is in YAML format and the preferred default. YAML is a file format which describes data structures
# in a non-verbose, humanly-readable format. It ships with Ruby 1.8.1+.
#
# Unlike single-file fixtures, YAML fixtures are stored in a single file per model, which is place in the directory appointed
# by <tt>Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path=(path)</tt> (this is automatically configured for Rails, so you can just
# put your files in <your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/). The fixture file ends with the .yml file extension (Rails example:
# "<your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites.yml"). The format of a YAML fixture file looks like this:
#
#   rubyonrails:
#     id: 1
#     name: Ruby on Rails
#     url: http://www.rubyonrails.org
#
#   google:
#     id: 2
#     name: Google
#     url: http://www.google.com
#
# This YAML fixture file includes two fixtures.  Each YAML fixture (ie. record) is given a name and is followed by an
# indented list of key/value pairs in the "key: value" format.  Records are separated by a blank line for your viewing
# pleasure.
#
# = CSV fixtures
#
# Fixtures can also be kept in the Comma Separated Value format. Akin to YAML fixtures, CSV fixtures are stored
# in a single file, but, instead end with the .csv file extension (Rails example: "<your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites.csv")
#
# The format of this tye of fixture file is much more compact than the others, but also a little harder to read by us
# humans.  The first line of the CSV file is a comma-separated list of field names.  The rest of the file is then comprised
# of the actual data (1 per line).  Here's an example:
#
#   id, name, url
#   1, Ruby On Rails, http://www.rubyonrails.org
#   2, Google, http://www.google.com
#
# Should you have a piece of data with a comma character in it, you can place double quotes around that value.  If you
# need to use a double quote character, you must escape it with another double quote.
#
# Another unique attribute of the CSV fixture is that it has *no* fixture name like the other two formats.  Instead, the
# fixture names are automatically generated by deriving the class name of the fixture file and adding an incrementing
# number to the end.  In our example, the 1st fixture would be called "web_site_1" and the 2nd one would be called
# "web_site_2".
#
# Most databases and spreadsheets support exporting to CSV format, so this is a great format for you to choose if you
# have existing data somewhere already.
#
# = Single-file fixtures
#
# This type of fixtures was the original format for Active Record that has since been deprecated in favor of the YAML and CSV formats.
# Fixtures for this format are created by placing text files in a sub-directory (with the name of the model) to the directory
# appointed by <tt>Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path=(path)</tt> (this is automatically configured for Rails, so you can just
# put your files in <your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/<your-model-name>/ -- like <your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites/ for the WebSite
# model).
#
# Each text file placed in this directory represents a "record".  Usually these types of fixtures are named without
# extensions, but if you are on a Windows machine, you might consider adding .txt as the extension.  Here's what the
# above example might look like:
#
#   web_sites/google
#   web_sites/yahoo.txt
#   web_sites/ruby-on-rails
#
# The file format of a standard fixture is simple.  Each line is a property (or column in db speak) and has the syntax
# of "name => value".  Here's an example of the ruby-on-rails fixture above:
#
#   id => 1
#   name => Ruby on Rails
#   url => http://www.rubyonrails.org
#
# = Using Fixtures
#
# Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests.  There are two ways to use the
# fixtures, but first lets take a look at a sample unit test found:
#
#   require 'web_site'
#
#   class WebSiteTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
#     def test_web_site_count
#       assert_equal 2, WebSite.count
#     end
#   end
#
# As it stands, unless we pre-load the web_site table in our database with two records, this test will fail.  Here's the
# easiest way to add fixtures to the database:
#
#   ...
#   class WebSiteTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
#     fixtures :web_sites # add more by separating the symbols with commas
#   ...
#
# By adding a "fixtures" method to the test case and passing it a list of symbols (only one is shown here tho), we trigger
# the testing environment to automatically load the appropriate fixtures into the database before each test, and
# automatically delete them after each test.
#
# In addition to being available in the database, the fixtures are also loaded into a hash stored in an instance variable
# of the test case.  It is named after the symbol... so, in our example, there would be a hash available called
# @web_sites.  This is where the "fixture name" comes into play.
#
# On top of that, each record is automatically "found" (using Model.find(id)) and placed in the instance variable of its name.
# So for the YAML fixtures, we'd get @rubyonrails and @google, which could be interrogated using regular Active Record semantics:
#
#   # test if the object created from the fixture data has the same attributes as the data itself
#   def test_find
#     assert_equal @web_sites["rubyonrails"]["name"], @rubyonrails.name
#   end
#
# As seen above, the data hash created from the YAML fixtures would have @web_sites["rubyonrails"]["url"] return
# "http://www.rubyonrails.org" and @web_sites["google"]["name"] would return "Google". The same fixtures, but loaded
# from a CSV fixture file would be accessible via @web_sites["web_site_1"]["name"] == "Ruby on Rails" and have the individual
# fixtures available as instance variables @web_site_1 and @web_site_2.
#
# = Dynamic fixtures with ERb
#
# Some times you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume. In these cases, you can
# mix ERb in with your YAML or CSV fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load testing, like:
#
# <% for i in 1..1000 %>
# fix_<%= i %>:
#   id: <%= i %>
#   name: guy_<%= 1 %>
# <% end %>
#
# This will create 1000 very simple YAML fixtures.
#
# Using ERb, you can also inject dynamic values into your fixtures with inserts like <%= Date.today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>.
# This is however a feature to be used with some caution. The point of fixtures are that they're stable units of predictable
# sample data. If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then perhaps you should reexamine whether your application
# is properly testable. Hence, dynamic values in fixtures are to be considered a code smell.
