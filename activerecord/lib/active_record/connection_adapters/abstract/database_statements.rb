      # == Transaction callbacks
      #
      # #transaction yields an ActiveRecord::Transaction object on which it is
      # possible to register callback:
      #
      #   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do |transaction|
      #     transaction.before_commit { puts "before commit!" }
      #     transaction.after_commit { puts "after commit!" }
      #     transaction.after_rollback { puts "after rollback!" }
      #   end
      #
      # == Nested transactions support
      #
      # #transaction calls can be nested. By default, this makes all database
      # statements in the nested transaction block become part of the parent
      # transaction. For example, the following behavior may be surprising:
      #
      #   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      #     Post.create(title: 'first')
      #     ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      #       Post.create(title: 'second')
      #       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # This creates both "first" and "second" posts. Reason is the
      # ActiveRecord::Rollback exception in the nested block does not issue a
      # ROLLBACK. Since these exceptions are captured in transaction blocks,
      # the parent block does not see it and the real transaction is committed.
      #
      # Most databases don't support true nested transactions. At the time of
      # writing, the only database that supports true nested transactions that
      # we're aware of, is MS-SQL.
      #
      # In order to get around this problem, #transaction will emulate the effect
      # of nested transactions, by using savepoints:
      # https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/savepoint.html.
      #
      # It is safe to call this method if a database transaction is already open,
      # i.e. if #transaction is called within another #transaction block. In case
      # of a nested call, #transaction will behave as follows:
      #
      # - The block will be run without doing anything. All database statements
      #   that happen within the block are effectively appended to the already
      #   open database transaction.
      # - However, if +:requires_new+ is set, the block will be wrapped in a
      #   database savepoint acting as a sub-transaction.
      #
      # In order to get a ROLLBACK for the nested transaction you may ask for a
      # real sub-transaction by passing <tt>requires_new: true</tt>.
      # If anything goes wrong, the database rolls back to the beginning of
      # the sub-transaction without rolling back the parent transaction.
      # If we add it to the previous example:
      #
      #   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      #     Post.create(title: 'first')
      #     ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(requires_new: true) do
      #       Post.create(title: 'second')
      #       raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # only post with title "first" is created.
      #
      # See ActiveRecord::Transactions to learn more.
      #
      # === Caveats
      #
      # MySQL doesn't support DDL transactions. If you perform a DDL operation,
      # then any created savepoints will be automatically released. For example,
      # if you've created a savepoint, then you execute a CREATE TABLE statement,
      # then the savepoint that was created will be automatically released.
      #
      # This means that, on MySQL, you shouldn't execute DDL operations inside
      # a #transaction call that you know might create a savepoint. Otherwise,
      # #transaction will raise exceptions when it tries to release the
      # already-automatically-released savepoints:
      #
      #   Model.lease_connection.transaction do  # BEGIN
      #     Model.lease_connection.transaction(requires_new: true) do  # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
      #       Model.lease_connection.create_table(...)
      #       # active_record_1 now automatically released
      #     end  # RELEASE SAVEPOINT active_record_1  <--- BOOM! database error!
      #   end
      #
      # == Transaction isolation
      #
      # If your database supports setting the isolation level for a transaction, you can set
      # it like so:
      #
      #   Post.transaction(isolation: :serializable) do
      #     # ...
      #   end
      #
      # Valid isolation levels are:
      #
      # * <tt>:read_uncommitted</tt>
      # * <tt>:read_committed</tt>
      # * <tt>:repeatable_read</tt>
      # * <tt>:serializable</tt>
      #
      # You should consult the documentation for your database to understand the
      # semantics of these different levels:
      #
      # * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/transaction-iso.html
      # * https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set-transaction.html
      #
      # An ActiveRecord::TransactionIsolationError will be raised if:
      #
      # * The adapter does not support setting the isolation level
      # * You are joining an existing open transaction
      # * You are creating a nested (savepoint) transaction
      #
      # The mysql2, trilogy, and postgresql adapters support setting the transaction
      # isolation level.
      #  :args: (requires_new: nil, isolation: nil, &block)
      def transaction(requires_new: nil, isolation: nil, joinable: true, &block)
