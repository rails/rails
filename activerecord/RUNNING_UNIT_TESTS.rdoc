== Setup

If you don't have an environment for running tests, read
https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#setting-up-a-development-environment

== Running the Tests

To run a specific test:

  $ bundle exec ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb -n method_name

To run a set of tests:

  $ bundle exec ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb

You can also run tests that depend upon a specific database backend. For
example:

  $ bundle exec rake test:sqlite3

Simply executing <tt>bundle exec rake test</tt> is equivalent to the following:

  $ bundle exec rake test:mysql2
  $ bundle exec rake test:postgresql
  $ bundle exec rake test:sqlite3

Using the SQLite3 adapter with an in-memory database is the fastest way
to run the tests:

  $ bundle exec rake test:sqlite3_mem

There should be tests available for each database backend listed in the {Config
File}[rdoc-label:label-Config+File]. (the exact set of available tests is
defined in +Rakefile+)

There are some performance tests for the encryption system that can be run with.

  $ rake test:encryption:performance:mysql2
  $ rake test:integration:active_job:postgresql
  $ rake test:encryption:performance:sqlite3

These performance tests are not executed as part of the regular testing tasks.

== Config File

If +test/config.yml+ is present, then its parameters are obeyed; otherwise, the
parameters in +test/config.example.yml+ are.

You can override the +connections:+ parameter in either file using the +ARCONN+
(Active Record CONNection) environment variable:

  $ ARCONN=postgresql bundle exec ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb

Or

  $ bundle exec rake test:postgresql TEST=test/cases/base_test.rb

You can specify a custom location for the config file using the +ARCONFIG+
environment variable.
