== Creating the test database

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection adapter setups you want to test with in 
test/connections/<your database>/connection.rb. 
When you have the database online, you can import the fixture tables with 
the test/fixtures/db_definitions/*.sql files.

Make sure that you create database objects with the same user that you specified in i
connection.rb otherwise (on Postgres, at least) tests for default values will fail.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all the adapters. You can also run the suite on just
one adapter by using the tasks test_mysql_ruby, test_ruby_mysql, test_sqlite, 
or test_postresql. For more information, checkout the full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in test directory. If you only want to run a single test suite, 
or don't want to bother with Rake, you can do so with something like:

   cd test; ruby -I "connections/native_mysql" base_test.rb
   
That'll run the base suite using the MySQL-Ruby adapter. Change the adapter
and test suite name as needed.

You can also run all the suites on a specific adapter with:

   cd test; all.sh "connections/native_mysql"

== Faster tests

If you are using a database that supports transactions, you can set the
"AR_TX_FIXTURES" environment variable to "yes" to use transactional fixtures.
This gives a very large speed boost. With rake:

  rake AR_TX_FIXTURES=yes

Or, by hand:

  AR_TX_FIXTURES=yes ruby -I connections/native_sqlite3 base_test.rb
