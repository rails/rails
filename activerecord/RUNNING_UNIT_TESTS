== Setup

If you don't have the environment set make sure to read

    http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#testing-active-record.

== Running the Tests

You can run a particular test file from the command line, e.g.

  $ ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb

To run a specific test:

  $ ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb -n test_something_works

You can run with a database other than the default you set in test/config.yml, using the ARCONN
environment variable:

  $ ARCONN=postgresql ruby -Itest test/cases/base_test.rb

You can run all the tests for a given database via rake:

  $ rake test_mysql

The 'rake test' task will run all the tests for mysql, mysql2, sqlite3 and postgresql.

== Custom Config file

By default, the config file is expected to be at the path test/config.yml. You can specify a
custom location with the ARCONFIG environment variable.
