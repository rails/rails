*   Allow to reset cache counters for multiple records.

    ```
    Aircraft.reset_counters([1, 2, 3], :wheels_count)
    ```

    It produces much fewer queries compared to the custom implementation using looping over ids.
    Previously: `O(ids.size * counters.size)` queries, now: `O(ids.size + counters.size)` queries.

*   Add `affected_rows` to `sql.active_record` Notification.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Fix `sum` when performing a grouped calculation.

    `User.group(:friendly).sum` no longer worked. This is fixed.

    *Edouard Chin*

*   Add support for enabling or disabling transactional tests per database.

    A test class can now override the default `use_transactional_tests` setting
    for individual databases, which can be useful if some databases need their
    current state to be accessible to an external process while tests are running.

    ```ruby
    class MostlyTransactionalTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
      self.use_transactional_tests = true
      skip_transactional_tests_for_database :shared
    end
    ```

    *Matthew Cheetham*, *Morgan Mareve*

*   Cast `query_cache` value when using URL configuration.

    *zzak*

*   NULLS NOT DISTINCT works with UNIQUE CONSTRAINT as well as UNIQUE INDEX.

    *Ryuta Kamizono*

*   `PG::UnableToSend: no connection to the server` is now retryable as a connection-related exception

    *Kazuma Watanabe*
