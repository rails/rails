  # # Action Cable Remote Connections
  #
  # If you need to disconnect a given connection, you can go through the
  # RemoteConnections. You can find the connections you're looking for by
  # searching for the identifier declared on the connection. For example:
  #
  #     module ApplicationCable
  #       class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
  #         identified_by :current_user
  #         ....
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect
  #
  # This will disconnect all the connections established for `User.find(1)`,
  # across all servers running on all machines, because it uses the internal
  # channel that all of these servers are subscribed to.
  #
  # By default, server sends a "disconnect" message with "reconnect" flag set to
  # true. You can override it by specifying the `reconnect` option:
  #
  #     ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect(reconnect: false)
  class RemoteConnections
    attr_reader :server

    def initialize(server)
      @server = server
    end

    def where(identifier)
      RemoteConnection.new(server, identifier)
    end

    # # Action Cable Remote Connection
    #
    # Represents a single remote connection found via
    # `ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(*)`. Exists solely for the
    # purpose of calling #disconnect on that connection.
    class RemoteConnection
      class InvalidIdentifiersError < StandardError; end

      include Connection::Identification, Connection::InternalChannel

      def initialize(server, ids)
        @server = server
        set_identifier_instance_vars(ids)
      end

      # Uses the internal channel to disconnect the connection.
      def disconnect(reconnect: true)
        server.broadcast internal_channel, { type: "disconnect", reconnect: reconnect }
      end

      # Returns all the identifiers that were applied to this connection.

        server.connection_identifiers
      end
