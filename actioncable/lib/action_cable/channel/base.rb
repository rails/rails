    # # Action Cable Channel Base
    #
    # The channel provides the basic structure of grouping behavior into logical
    # units when communicating over the WebSocket connection. You can think of a
    # channel like a form of controller, but one that's capable of pushing content
    # to the subscriber in addition to simply responding to the subscriber's direct
    # requests.
    #
    # Channel instances are long-lived. A channel object will be instantiated when
    # the cable consumer becomes a subscriber, and then lives until the consumer
    # disconnects. This may be seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. That means you
    # have to take special care not to do anything silly in a channel that would
    # balloon its memory footprint or whatever. The references are forever, so they
    # won't be released as is normally the case with a controller instance that gets
    # thrown away after every request.
    #
    # Long-lived channels (and connections) also mean you're responsible for
    # ensuring that the data is fresh. If you hold a reference to a user record, but
    # the name is changed while that reference is held, you may be sending stale
    # data if you don't take precautions to avoid it.
    #
    # The upside of long-lived channel instances is that you can use instance
    # variables to keep reference to objects that future subscriber requests can
    # interact with. Here's a quick example:
    #
    #     class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #       def subscribed
    #         @room = Chat::Room[params[:room_number]]
    #       end
    #
    #       def speak(data)
    #         @room.speak data, user: current_user
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The #speak action simply uses the Chat::Room object that was created when the
    # channel was first subscribed to by the consumer when that subscriber wants to
    # say something in the room.
    #
    # ## Action processing
    #
    # Unlike subclasses of ActionController::Base, channels do not follow a RESTful
    # constraint form for their actions. Instead, Action Cable operates through a
    # remote-procedure call model. You can declare any public method on the channel
    # (optionally taking a `data` argument), and this method is automatically
    # exposed as callable to the client.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     class AppearanceChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #       def subscribed
    #         @connection_token = generate_connection_token
    #       end
    #
    #       def unsubscribed
    #         current_user.disappear @connection_token
    #       end
    #
    #       def appear(data)
    #         current_user.appear @connection_token, on: data['appearing_on']
    #       end
    #
    #       def away
    #         current_user.away @connection_token
    #       end
    #
    #       private
    #         def generate_connection_token
    #           SecureRandom.hex(36)
    #         end
    #     end
    #
    # In this example, the subscribed and unsubscribed methods are not callable
    # methods, as they were already declared in ActionCable::Channel::Base, but
    # `#appear` and `#away` are. `#generate_connection_token` is also not callable,
    # since it's a private method. You'll see that appear accepts a data parameter,
    # which it then uses as part of its model call. `#away` does not, since it's
    # simply a trigger action.
    #
    # Also note that in this example, `current_user` is available because it was
    # marked as an identifying attribute on the connection. All such identifiers
    # will automatically create a delegation method of the same name on the channel
    # instance.
    #
    # ## Rejecting subscription requests
    #
    # A channel can reject a subscription request in the #subscribed callback by
    # invoking the #reject method:
    #
    #     class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #       def subscribed
    #         @room = Chat::Room[params[:room_number]]
    #         reject unless current_user.can_access?(@room)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # In this example, the subscription will be rejected if the `current_user` does
    # not have access to the chat room. On the client-side, the `Channel#rejected`
    # callback will get invoked when the server rejects the subscription request.
