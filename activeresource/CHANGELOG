*2.0.2* (December 16th, 2007)

* Added more specific exceptions for 400, 401, and 403 (all descending from ClientError so existing rescues will work) #10326 [trek]

* Correct empty response handling.  #10445 [seangeo]


*2.0.1* (December 7th, 2007)

* Don't cache net/http object so that ActiveResource is more thread-safe.  Closes #10142 [kou]

* Update XML documentation examples to include explicit type attributes. Closes #9754 [hasmanyjosh]

* Added one-off declarations of mock behavior [DHH]. Example:

    Before:
      ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to do |mock|
        mock.get "/people/1.xml", {}, "<person><name>David</name></person>"
      end
      
    Now:
      ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to.get "/people/1.xml", {}, "<person><name>David</name></person>"

* Added ActiveResource.format= which defaults to :xml but can also be set to :json [DHH]. Example:

    class Person < ActiveResource::Base
      self.site   = "http://app/"
      self.format = :json
    end
    
    person = Person.find(1) # => GET http://app/people/1.json
    person.name = "David"
    person.save             # => PUT http://app/people/1.json {name: "David"}
    
    Person.format = :xml
    person.name = "Mary"
    person.save             # => PUT http://app/people/1.json <person><name>Mary</name></person>    

* Fix reload error when path prefix is used.  #8727 [Ian Warshak]

* Remove ActiveResource::Struct because it hasn't proven very useful. Creating a new ActiveResource::Base subclass is often less code and always clearer.  #8612 [Josh Peek]

* Fix query methods on resources. [Cody Fauser]

* pass the prefix_options to the instantiated record when using find without a specific id. Closes #8544 [alloy]

* Recognize and raise an exception on 405 Method Not Allowed responses.  #7692 [Josh Peek]

* Handle string and symbol param keys when splitting params into prefix params and query params.

    Comment.find(:all, :params => { :article_id => 5, :page => 2 }) or Comment.find(:all, :params => { 'article_id' => 5, :page => 2 })

* Added find-one with symbol [DHH]. Example: Person.find(:one, :from => :leader) # => GET /people/leader.xml

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Changed the finder API to be more extensible with :params and more strict usage of scopes [DHH]. Changes:

    Person.find(:all, :title => "CEO")      ...becomes: Person.find(:all, :params => { :title => "CEO" })
    Person.find(:managers)                  ...becomes: Person.find(:all, :from => :managers)
    Person.find("/companies/1/manager.xml") ...becomes: Person.find(:one, :from => "/companies/1/manager.xml")

* Add support for setting custom headers per Active Resource model [Rick]

  class Project
    headers['X-Token'] = 'foo'
  end
  
  # makes the GET request with the custom X-Token header
  Project.find(:all)

* Added find-by-path options to ActiveResource::Base.find [DHH]. Examples:

    employees = Person.find(:all, :from => "/companies/1/people.xml") # => GET /companies/1/people.xml
    manager   = Person.find("/companies/1/manager.xml")               # => GET /companies/1/manager.xml


* Added support for using classes from within a single nested module [DHH]. Example:

    module Highrise
      class Note < ActiveResource::Base
        self.site = "http://37s.sunrise.i:3000"
      end

      class Comment < ActiveResource::Base
        self.site = "http://37s.sunrise.i:3000"
      end
    end

  assert_kind_of Highrise::Comment, Note.find(1).comments.first
    

* Added load_attributes_from_response as a way of loading attributes from other responses than just create [DHH]

    class Highrise::Task < ActiveResource::Base
      def complete
        load_attributes_from_response(post(:complete))
      end
    end

  ...will set "done_at" when complete is called.


* Added support for calling custom methods #6979 [rwdaigle]

    Person.find(:managers)    # => GET /people/managers.xml
    Kase.find(1).post(:close) # => POST /kases/1/close.xml

* Remove explicit prefix_options parameter for ActiveResource::Base#initialize. [Rick]
  ActiveResource splits the prefix_options from it automatically.

* Allow ActiveResource::Base.delete with custom prefix. [Rick]

* Add ActiveResource::Base#dup [Rick]

* Fixed constant warning when fetching the same object multiple times [DHH]

* Added that saves which get a body response (and not just a 201) will use that response to update themselves [DHH]

* Disregard namespaces from the default element name, so Highrise::Person will just try to fetch from "/people", not "/highrise/people" [DHH]

* Allow array and hash query parameters.  #7756 [Greg Spurrier]

* Loading a resource preserves its prefix_options.  #7353 [Ryan Daigle]

* Carry over the convenience of #create from ActiveRecord.  Closes #7340.  [Ryan Daigle]

* Increase ActiveResource::Base test coverage.  Closes #7173, #7174 [Rich Collins]

* Interpret 422 Unprocessable Entity as ResourceInvalid.  #7097 [dkubb]

* Mega documentation patches. #7025, #7069 [rwdaigle]

* Base.exists?(id, options) and Base#exists? check whether the resource is found.  #6970 [rwdaigle]

* Query string support.  [untext, Jeremy Kemper]
    # GET /forums/1/topics.xml?sort=created_at
    Topic.find(:all, :forum_id => 1, :sort => 'created_at')

* Base#==, eql?, and hash methods. == returns true if its argument is identical to self or if it's an instance of the same class, is not new?, and has the same id. eql? is an alias for ==. hash delegates to id.  [Jeremy Kemper]

* Allow subclassed resources to share the site info [Rick, Jeremy Kemper]
d
    class BeastResource < ActiveResource::Base
      self.site = 'http://beast.caboo.se'
    end

    class Forum < BeastResource
      # taken from BeastResource
      # self.site = 'http://beast.caboo.se'
    end

    class Topic < BeastResource
      self.site += '/forums/:forum_id'
    end

* Fix issues with ActiveResource collection handling.  Closes #6291. [bmilekic]

* Use attr_accessor_with_default to dry up attribute initialization. References #6538. [Stuart Halloway]

* Add basic logging support for logging outgoing requests. [Jamis Buck]

* Add Base.delete for deleting resources without having to instantiate them first. [Jamis Buck]

* Make #save behavior mimic AR::Base#save (true on success, false on failure). [Jamis Buck]

* Add Basic HTTP Authentication to ActiveResource (closes #6305). [jonathan]

* Extracted #id_from_response as an entry point for customizing how a created resource gets its own ID.
  By default, it extracts from the Location response header.

* Optimistic locking: raise ActiveResource::ResourceConflict on 409 Conflict response. [Jeremy Kemper]

    # Example controller action
    def update
      @person.save!
    rescue ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
      render :xml => @person.reload.to_xml, :status => '409 Conflict'
    end

* Basic validation support [Rick Olson]

  Parses the xml response of ActiveRecord::Errors#to_xml with a similar interface to ActiveRecord::Errors.  
  
    render :xml => @person.errors.to_xml, :status => '400 Validation Error'

* Deep hashes are converted into collections of resources.  [Jeremy Kemper]
    Person.new :name => 'Bob',
               :address => { :id => 1, :city => 'Portland' },
               :contacts => [{ :id => 1 }, { :id => 2 }]
  Looks for Address and Contact resources and creates them if unavailable.
  So clients can fetch a complex resource in a single request if you e.g.
    render :xml => @person.to_xml(:include => [:address, :contacts])
  in your controller action.

* Major updates [Rick Olson]

  * Add full support for find/create/update/destroy
  * Add support for specifying prefixes.
  * Allow overriding of element_name, collection_name, and primary key
  * Provide simpler HTTP mock interface for testing
  
    # rails routing code
    map.resources :posts do |post|
      post.resources :comments
    end
    
    # ActiveResources
    class Post < ActiveResource::Base
      self.site = "http://37s.sunrise.i:3000/"
    end

    class Comment < ActiveResource::Base
      self.site = "http://37s.sunrise.i:3000/posts/:post_id/"
    end
    
    @post     = Post.find 5
    @comments = Comment.find :all, :post_id => @post.id

    @comment  = Comment.new({:body => 'hello world'}, {:post_id => @post.id})
    @comment.save

* Base.site= accepts URIs. 200...400 are valid response codes. PUT and POST request bodies default to ''. [Jeremy Kemper]

* Initial checkin: object-oriented client for restful HTTP resources which follow the Rails convention. [DHH]
