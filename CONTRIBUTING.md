## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Rails**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://rubyonrails.org/security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Active Record** (models, database) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record.rb)
  * [**Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller.rb)
  * [**Generic template** for other issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/guides/bug_report_templates/generic.rb)

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#reporting-an-issue).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Ruby on Rails](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [rubyonrails-core mailing list](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* We generally reject changes to Active Support core extensions. Those change should be proposed in the [Ruby issue tracker instead](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues), as we don't want to conflict with future versions of Ruby.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [rubyonrails-talk mailing list](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-talk).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Rails Documentation](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation).

Ruby on Rails is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org)!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
