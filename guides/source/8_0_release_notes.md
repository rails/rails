Ruby on Rails 8.0 Release Notes
===============================

Highlights in Rails 8.0:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading to Rails 8.0
----------------------

If you're upgrading an existing application, it's a great idea to have good test
coverage before going in. You should also first upgrade to Rails 7.2 in case you
haven't and make sure your application still runs as expected before attempting
an update to Rails 8.0. A list of things to watch out for when upgrading is
available in the
[Upgrading Ruby on Rails](upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-7-2-to-rails-8-0)
guide.

Major Features
--------------

### Kamal 2

Rails now comes preconfigured with [Kamal 2](https://kamal-deploy.org/) for 
deploying your application. Kamal takes a fresh Linux box and turns it into an 
application or accessory server with just a single “kamal setup” command.

Kamal 2 also includes a proxy called [Kamal Proxy](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-proxy) 
to replace the generic Traefik option it used at launch.

### Thruster

The Dockerfile has been upgraded to include a new proxy called 
[Thruster](https://github.com/basecamp/thruster), which sits in front of the 
Puma web server to provide X-Sendfile acceleration, asset caching, and asset 
compression.

### Solid Cable

[Solid Cable](https://github.com/rails/solid_cable) replaces Redis to act as 
the pubsub server to relay WebSocket messages from the application to clients 
connected to different processes. Solid Cable retains the messages sent in 
the database for a day by default.

### Solid Cache

[Solid Cache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache) replaces either 
Redis or Memcached for storing HTML fragment caches in particular.

### Solid Queue

[Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue) replaces the need for 
Redis, also a separate job-running framework, like Resque, Delayed Job, or 
Sidekiq. 

For high-performance installations, it’s built on the new `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` 
mechanism first introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5, but now also available in MySQL 8.0
and beyond. It also works with SQLite.

### Propshaft

[Propshaft](https://github.com/rails/propshaft) is now the default asset 
pipeline, replacing the old Sprockets system.

### Authentication

[Authentication system generator](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52328), 
creates a starting point for a session-based, password-resettable, 
metadata-tracking authentication system.
