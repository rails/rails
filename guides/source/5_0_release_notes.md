--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading to Rails 5.0
----------------------

If you're upgrading an existing application, it's a great idea to have good test
coverage before going in. You should also first upgrade to Rails 4.2 in case you
haven't and make sure your application still runs as expected before attempting
an update to Rails 5.0. A list of things to watch out for when upgrading is
available in the
[Upgrading Ruby on Rails](upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-4-2-to-rails-5-0)
guide.


Major Features
--------------

### Action Cable

Action Cable is a new framework in Rails 5. It seamlessly integrates
[WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) with the rest of your
Rails application.

Action Cable allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the
same style and form as the rest of your Rails application, while still being
performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a
client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have
access to your full domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of
choice.

See the [Action Cable Overview](action_cable_overview.html) guide for more
information.

### API Applications

Rails can now be used to create slimmed down API only applications.
This is useful for creating and serving APIs similar to [X](https://developer.x.com) or [GitHub](https://developer.github.com) API,
that can be used to serve public-facing, as well as, for custom applications.

You can generate a new api Rails app using:

```bash
$ rails new my_api --api
```

This will do three main things:

- Configure your application to start with a more limited set of middleware
  than normal. Specifically, it will not include any middleware primarily useful
  for browser applications (like cookies support) by default.
- Make `ApplicationController` inherit from `ActionController::API` instead of
  `ActionController::Base`. As with middleware, this will leave out any Action
  Controller modules that provide functionalities primarily used by browser
  applications.
- Configure the generators to skip generating views, helpers, and assets when
  you generate a new resource.

The application provides a base for APIs,
that can then be [configured to pull in functionality](api_app.html) as suitable for the application's needs.

See the [Using Rails for API-only Applications](api_app.html) guide for more
information.

### Active Record attributes API

Defines an attribute with a type on a model. It will override the type of existing attributes if needed.
This allows control over how values are converted to and from SQL when assigned to a model.
It also changes the behavior of values passed to `ActiveRecord::Base.where`, which let's use our domain objects across much of Active Record,
without having to rely on implementation details or monkey patching.

Some things that you can achieve with this:

- The type detected by Active Record can be overridden.
- A default can also be provided.
- Attributes do not need to be backed by a database column.

```ruby
# db/schema.rb
create_table :store_listings, force: true do |t|
  t.decimal :price_in_cents
  t.string :my_string, default: "original default"
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/store_listing.rb
class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```ruby
store_listing = StoreListing.new(price_in_cents: '10.1')

# before
store_listing.price_in_cents # => BigDecimal.new(10.1)
StoreListing.new.my_string # => "original default"

class StoreListing < ActiveRecord::Base
  attribute :price_in_cents, :integer # custom type
  attribute :my_string, :string, default: "new default" # default value
  attribute :my_default_proc, :datetime, default: -> { Time.now } # default value
  attribute :field_without_db_column, :integer, array: true
end

# after
store_listing.price_in_cents # => 10
StoreListing.new.my_string # => "new default"
StoreListing.new.my_default_proc # => 2015-05-30 11:04:48 -0600
model = StoreListing.new(field_without_db_column: ["1", "2", "3"])
model.attributes # => {field_without_db_column: [1, 2, 3]}
```

**Creating Custom Types:**

You can define your own custom types, as long as they respond
to the methods defined on the value type. The method `deserialize` or
`cast` will be called on your type object, with raw input from the
database or from your controllers. This is useful, for example, when doing custom conversion,
like Money data.

**Querying:**

When `ActiveRecord::Base.where` is called, it will
use the type defined by the model class to convert the value to SQL,
calling `serialize` on your type object.

This gives the objects ability to specify, how to convert values when performing SQL queries.

**Dirty Tracking:**

The type of an attribute is allowed to change how dirty
tracking is performed.

See its
[documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActiveRecord/Attributes/ClassMethods.html)
for a detailed write up.


### Test Runner

A new test runner has been introduced to enhance the capabilities of running tests from Rails.
To use this test runner simply type `bin/rails test`.

Test Runner is inspired by `RSpec`, `minitest-reporters`, `maxitest` and others.
It includes some of these notable advancements:

- Run a single test using line number of test.
- Run multiple tests pinpointing to line number of tests.
- Improved failure messages, which also add ease of re-running failed tests.
- Fail fast using `-f` option, to stop tests immediately on occurrence of failure,
instead of waiting for the suite to complete.
- Defer test output until the end of a full test run using the `-d` option.
- Complete exception backtrace output using `-b` option.
- Integration with minitest to allow options like `-s` for test seed data,
`-n` for running specific test by name, `-v` for better verbose output and so forth.
- Colored test output.

    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18374))

*   `ActionController::Live` became an `ActiveSupport::Concern`. That
    means it can't be just included in other modules without extending
    them with `ActiveSupport::Concern` or `ActionController::Live`
    won't take effect in production. Some people may be using another
    module to include some special `Warden`/`Devise` authentication
    failure handling code as well since the middleware can't catch a
    `:warden` thrown by a spawned thread which is the case when using
    `ActionController::Live`.
    ([More details in this issue](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/25581))

*   Introduce `Response#strong_etag=` and `#weak_etag=` and analogous
    options for `fresh_when` and `stale?`.

*   Deprecated `connection.tables` on the SQLite3 and MySQL adapters.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21601))

*   Deprecated passing arguments to `#tables` - the `#tables` method of some

    (postgresql) just return tables. To make their behavior consistent,
    `#tables` will return only tables in the future.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21601))

    discover which fields were read from a model when you are looking to only
    select the data you need from the database.
    ([commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/be9b68038e83a617eb38c26147659162e4ac3d2c))

*   Added the `#or` method on `ActiveRecord::Relation`, allowing use of the OR

*   Added `ActiveRecord::Base.suppress` to prevent the receiver from being saved
    during the given block.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18910))

    defaults without breaking existing migrations, or forcing them to be
    rewritten through a deprecation cycle.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21538))

*   `ApplicationRecord` is a new superclass for all app models, analogous to app
    controllers subclassing `ApplicationController` instead of
    `ActionController::Base`. This gives apps a single spot to configure app-wide
    model behavior.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/22567))

*   Added ActiveRecord `#second_to_last` and `#third_to_last` methods.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23583))

*   Added ability to annotate database objects (tables, columns, indexes)
    with comments stored in database metadata for PostgreSQL & MySQL.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/22911))

*   Added prepared statements support to `mysql2` adapter, for mysql2 0.4.4+,

    than the current time.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18956))

*   Change transaction callbacks to not swallow errors.
    Before this change any errors raised inside a transaction callback
    were getting rescued and printed in the logs, unless you used
    the (newly deprecated) `raise_in_transactional_callbacks = true` option.

    Now these errors are not rescued anymore and just bubble up, matching the
    behavior of other callbacks.
    ([commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/07d3d402341e81ada0214f2cb2be1da69eadfe72))

Active Job
-----------

Please refer to the [Changelog][active-job] for detailed changes.

### Notable changes

    they get performed.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18260))

     [Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20056),
     [commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/68e3279163d06e6b04e043f91c9470e9259bbbe0))

*   Implement a simple `AsyncJob` processor and associated `AsyncAdapter` that
    queue jobs to a `concurrent-ruby` thread pool.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21257))

*   Change the default adapter from inline to async. It's a better default as
    tests will then not mistakenly come to rely on behavior happening
    synchronously.
    ([commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/625baa69d14881ac49ba2e5c7d9cac4b222d7022))

    `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier`.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17727))

    to halt a callback chain from now on is to explicitly `throw(:abort)`.
    ([Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17227))

*   New config option
    `config.active_support.halt_callback_chains_on_return_false` to specify
    whether ActiveRecord, ActiveModel, and ActiveModel::Validations callback
