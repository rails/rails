The Basics of Creating Rails Plugins
====================================

This guide is for developers who want to create a Rails plugin, in order to
extend or modify the behavior of a Rails application.

After reading this guide, you will know:

* What Rails plugins are and when to use them.
* How to create a plugin from scratch.
* How to extend core Ruby classes.
* How to add methods to `ApplicationRecord`.
* How to publish your plugin to RubyGems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are Plugins?
-----------------

A Rails plugin is a packaged extension that adds functionality to a Rails
application. Plugins serve several purposes:

* They offer a way for developers to experiment with new ideas without affecting
  the stability of the core codebase.
* They support a modular architecture, allowing features to be maintained,
  updated, or released independently.
* They give teams an outlet for introducing powerful features without needing to
  include everything directly into the framework.

At a technical level, a plugin is a Ruby gem that’s designed to work inside a
Rails application. It often uses a
[Railtie](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Railtie.html) to hook into the
Rails boot process, allowing it to extend or modify the framework's behavior in
a structured way. A Railtie is the most
basic integration point for extending Rails — it’s typically used when your
plugin needs to add configuration, rake tasks, or initializer code, but doesn’t
expose any controllers, views, or models.

NOTE:
An [Engine](engines.html) is a more advanced type of plugin that behaves like a mini Rails
application. It can include its own routes, controllers, views, and even assets.
While all engines are plugins, not all plugins are engines. The main difference lies
in scope: plugins are typically used for smaller customizations or shared
behavior across apps, whereas engines provide more fully-featured components
with their own routes, models, and views.


Generator Options
------------------

Rails plugins are built as gems. They can be shared across different Rails
applications using [RubyGems](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)
and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/guides/creating_gem.html) if desired.

The `rails plugin new` command supports several options that determine what type
of plugin structure is generated.

The **Basic Plugin** (default), without any arguments, generates a minimal
plugin structure suitable for simple extensions like core class methods or
utility functions.

```bash
$ rails plugin new api_boost
```

We'll use the basic plugin generator for this guide. There are two options,
`--full` and `--mountable`, which are covered in the [Rails Engines
guide](engines.html).

The **Full Plugin** (`--full`) option creates a more complete plugin structure
that includes an `app` directory tree (models, views, controllers), a
`config/routes.rb` file, and an Engine class at `lib/api_boost/engine.rb`.

```bash
$ rails plugin new api_boost --full
```

Use `--full` when your plugin needs its own models, controllers, or views but
doesn't require namespace isolation.

The **Mountable Engine** (`--mountable`) option creates a fully isolated,
mountable engine that includes everything from `--full` plus:

- Namespace isolation (`ApiBoost::` prefix for all classes)
- Isolated routing (`ApiBoost::Engine.routes.draw`)
- Asset manifest files
- Namespaced `ApplicationController` and `ApplicationHelper`
- Automatic mounting in the dummy app for testing

```bash
$ rails plugin new api_boost --mountable
```

Use `--mountable` when building a self-contained feature that could work as a
separate application.

For more information about engines, see the [Getting Started with Engines
guide](engines.html).

Below is some guidance on choosing the right option:

- **Basic plugin**: Simple utilities, core class extensions, or small helper
  methods
- **`--full` plugin**: Complex functionality that needs models/controllers but
  shares the host app's namespace
- **`--mountable` engine**: Self-contained features like admin panels, blogs, or
  API modules

See usage and options by asking for help:

```bash
$ rails plugin new --help
```

Setup
------

For the purpose of this guide, imagine you're building APIs and want to create a
plugin that adds common API functionality like request throttling, response
caching, and automatic API documentation. You'll create a plugin called
"ApiBoost" that can enhance any Rails API application.

### Generate the Plugin

Create a basic plugin with the command:

```bash
$ rails plugin new api_boost
```

This will create the ApiBoost plugin in a directory named `api_boost`. Let's
examine what was generated:

```
api_boost/
├── api_boost.gemspec
├── Gemfile
├── lib/
│   ├── api_boost/
│   │   └── version.rb
│   ├── api_boost.rb
│   └── tasks/
│       └── api_boost_tasks.rake
├── test/
│   ├── dummy/
│   │   ├── app/
│   │   ├── bin/
│   │   ├── config/
│   │   ├── db/
│   │   ├── public/
│   │   └── ... (full Rails application)
│   ├── integration/
│   └── test_helper.rb
├── MIT-LICENSE
└── README.md
```

**The `lib` directory** contains your plugin's source code:

- `lib/api_boost.rb` is the main entry point for your plugin
- `lib/api_boost/` contains modules and classes for your plugin functionality
- `lib/tasks/` contains any Rake tasks your plugin provides

**The `test/dummy` directory** contains a complete Rails application that's used
for testing your plugin. This dummy application:

- Loads your plugin automatically through the Gemfile
- Provides a Rails environment to test your plugin's integration
- Includes generators, models, controllers, and views as needed for testing
- Can be used interactively with `rails console` and `rails server`

**The Gemspec file** (`api_boost.gemspec`) defines your gem's metadata,
dependencies, and the files to include when packaging.


### Set Up the Plugin

Navigate to the directory that contains the plugin, and edit `api_boost.gemspec`
to replace any lines that have `TODO` values:

```ruby
spec.homepage    = "http://example.com"
spec.summary     = "Enhance your API endpoints"
spec.description = "Adds common API functionality like request throttling, response caching, and automatic API documentation."

...

spec.metadata["source_code_uri"] = "http://example.com"
spec.metadata["changelog_uri"] = "http://example.com"
```

Then run the `bundle install` command.

After that, set up your testing database by navigating to the `test/dummy`
directory and running the following command:

```bash
$ cd test/dummy
$ bin/rails db:create
```

The dummy application works just like any Rails application - you can generate
models, run migrations, start the server, or open a console to test the plugin's
functionality as you develop it.

Once the database is created, return to the plugin's root directory (`cd
../..`).

Now you can run the tests using the `bin/test` command, and you should see:

```bash
$ bin/test
...
1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

This will tell you that everything got generated properly, and you are ready to
start adding functionality.

Extending Core Classes
----------------------

This section will explain how to add a method to
[Integer](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Integer.html) that will be
available anywhere in your Rails application.

WARNING: Before proceeding, it's important to understand that extending core
classes (like String, Array, Hash, etc.) should be used sparingly, if at all.
Core class extensions can be brittle, dangerous, and are often
unnecessary.<br></br> They can:</br>
- Cause naming conflicts when multiple gems extend the same class with the same
  method name</br>
- Break unexpectedly when Ruby or Rails updates change core class behavior</br>
- Make debugging difficult because it's not obvious where methods come from</br>
- Create coupling issues between your plugin and other code<br></br> Better
alternatives to consider:</br>
- Create utility modules or helper classes instead</br>
- Use composition over monkey patching</br>
- Implement functionality as instance methods on your own classes<br></br> For
more details on why core class extensions can be problematic, see [The Case
Against Monkey
Patching](https://shopify.engineering/the-case-against-monkey-patching).
<br></br> That said, understanding how core class extensions work is valuable.
The example below demonstrates the technique, but they should be used sparingly.

In this example you will add a method to Integer named `requests_per_hour`.

In `lib/api_boost.rb`, add `require "api_boost/core_ext"`:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost.rb

require "api_boost/version"
require "api_boost/railtie"
require "api_boost/core_ext"

module ApiBoost
  # Your code goes here...
end
```

Create the `core_ext.rb` file and add a method to Integer to define a RateLimit
that could define `10.requests_per_hour`, similar to `10.hours` that returns a
Time.

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/core_ext.rb

ApiBoost::RateLimit = Data.define(:requests, :per)

class Integer
  def requests_per_hour
    ApiBoost::RateLimit.new(self, :hour)
  end
end
```

To see this in action, change to the `test/dummy` directory, start `bin/rails
console`, and test the API response formatting:

```bash
$ cd test/dummy
$ bin/rails console
```

```irb
irb> 10.requests_per_hour
=> #<struct ApiBoost::RateLimit requests=10, per=:hour>
```

The dummy application automatically loads your plugin, so any extensions you add
are immediately available for testing.

Add an "acts_as" Method to Active Record
----------------------------------------

A common pattern in plugins is to add a method called `acts_as_something` to
models. In this case, you want to write a method called `acts_as_api_resource`
that adds API-specific functionality to your Active Record models.

Let’s say you’re building an API, and you want to keep track of the last time a
resource (like a `Product`) was accessed via that API. You might want to use
that timestamp to:

* throttle requests
* show “last active” times in your admin panel
* prioritize stale records for syncing

Instead of writing this logic in every model, you can use a shared plugin. The
`acts_as_api_resource` method adds this functionality to any model, letting you
track API activity by updating a timestamp field.

To begin, set up your files so that you have:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost.rb

require "api_boost/version"
require "api_boost/railtie"
require "api_boost/core_ext"
require "api_boost/acts_as_api_resource"

module ApiBoost
  # Your code goes here...
end
```

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/acts_as_api_resource.rb

module ApiBoost
  module ActsAsApiResource
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    class_methods do
      def acts_as_api_resource(api_timestamp_field: :last_requested_at)
        # Create a class-level setting that stores which field to use for the API timestamp.
        cattr_accessor :api_timestamp_field, default: api_timestamp_field.to_s
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The code above uses `ActiveSupport::Concern` to simplify including modules with
both class and instance methods. Methods in the `class_methods` block become
class methods when the module is included. For more details, see the
[ActiveSupport::Concern API
documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html).

### Add a Class Method

By default, this plugin expects your model to have a column named
`last_requested_at`. However, since that column name might already be used for
something else, the plugin lets you customize it. You can override the default
by passing a different column name with the `api_timestamp_field:` option.
Internally, this value is stored in a class-level setting called
`api_timestamp_field`, which the plugin uses when updating the timestamp.

For example, if you want to use `last_api_call` instead of `last_requested_at` as
the column name, you can do the following:

First, generate some models in your "dummy" Rails application to test this
functionality. Run the following commands from the `test/dummy` directory:

```bash
$ cd test/dummy
$ bin/rails generate model Product last_requested_at:datetime last_api_call:datetime
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Now update the Product model so that it acts like an API resource:

```ruby
# test/dummy/app/models/product.rb

class Product < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_api_resource api_timestamp_field: :last_api_call
end
```

To make the plugin available to all models, include the module in
`ApplicationRecord` (we'll look at doing this automatically later):

```ruby
# test/dummy/app/models/application_record.rb

class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ApiBoost::ActsAsApiResource

  self.abstract_class = true
end
```

Now you can test this functionality in the Rails console:

```irb
irb> Product.api_timestamp_field
=> "last_api_call"
```

### Add an Instance Method

This plugin adds an instance method called `track_api_request` to any Active
Record model that calls `acts_as_api_resource`. This method sets the value of
the configured timestamp field to the current time (or a custom time if
provided), allowing you to track when an API request was made.

To add this behavior, update `acts_as_api_resource.rb`:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/acts_as_api_resource.rb

module ApiBoost
  module ActsAsApiResource
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    class_methods do
      def acts_as_api_resource(options = {})
        cattr_accessor :api_timestamp_field,
                       default: (options[:api_timestamp_field] || :last_requested_at).to_s
      end
    end

    def track_api_request(timestamp = Time.current)
      write_attribute(self.class.api_timestamp_field, timestamp)
    end
  end
end
```

NOTE: The use of `write_attribute` above to write to the field in model is just
one example of how a plugin can interact with the model, and will not always be
the right method to use. For example, you might prefer using `send`, which calls
the setter method

```ruby
send("#{self.class.api_timestamp_field}=", timestamp)
```

Now you can test the functionality in the Rails console:

```irb
irb> product = Product.new
irb> product.track_api_request
irb> product.last_api_call
=> 2025-06-01 10:31:15 UTC
```

Advanced Integration: Using Railties
------------------------------------

The plugin we've built so far works great for basic functionality. However, if
the plugin needs to integrate more deeply with Rails' framework, you'll want to
use a [Railtie](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Railtie.html).

A Railtie is required when your plugin needs to:

* Add configuration options accessible via `Rails.application.config`
* Automatically include modules in Rails classes without manual setup
* Provide Rake tasks to the host application
* Set up initializers that run during Rails boot
* Add middleware to the application stack
* Configure Rails generators
* Subscribe to `ActiveSupport::Notifications`

For simple plugins like ours that only extend core classes or add modules, a
Railtie isn't necessary.

### Configuration Options

Let's say you want to make the default rate limit in your
`to_throttled_response` method configurable. First, create a Railtie:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/railtie.rb

module ApiBoost
  class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
    config.api_boost = ActiveSupport::OrderedOptions.new
    config.api_boost.default_rate_limit = 60.requests_per_hour

    initializer "api_boost.configure" do |app|
      ApiBoost.configuration = app.config.api_boost
    end
  end
end
```

Add a configuration module to your plugin:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/configuration.rb

module ApiBoost
  mattr_accessor :configuration, default: nil

  def self.configure
    yield(configuration) if block_given?
  end
end
```

Update your core extension to use the configuration:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/core_ext.rb

module ApiBoost
  module ActsAsApiResource
    def to_throttled_json(rate_limit = ApiBoost.configuration.default_rate_limit)
      limit_window = 1.send(rate_limit.per).ago..
      num_of_requests = self.class.where(self.class.api_timestamp_field => limit_window).count
      if num_of_requests > rate_limit.requests
        { error: "Rate limit reached" }.to_json
      else
        to_json
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Require the new files in your main plugin file:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost.rb

require "api_boost/version"
require "api_boost/configuration"
require "api_boost/railtie"
require "api_boost/core_ext"
require "api_boost/acts_as_api_resource"

module ApiBoost
  # Your code goes here...
end
```

Now applications using your plugin can configure it:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.api_boost.default_rate_limit = "100 requests per hour"
```

### Automatic Module Inclusion

Instead of requiring users to manually include `ActsAsApiResource` in their
`ApplicationRecord`, you can use a Railtie to do it automatically:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/railtie.rb

module ApiBoost
  class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
    config.api_boost = ActiveSupport::OrderedOptions.new
    config.api_boost.default_rate_limit = 60.requests_per_hour

    initializer "api_boost.configure" do |app|
      ApiBoost.configuration = app.config.api_boost
    end

    initializer "api_boost.active_record" do
      ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
        include ApiBoost::ActsAsApiResource
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The `ActiveSupport.on_load` hook ensures your module is included at the right
time during Rails initialization, after ActiveRecord is fully loaded.

### Rake Tasks

To provide Rake tasks to applications using your plugin:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/api_boost/railtie.rb

module ApiBoost
  class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
    # ... existing configuration ...

    rake_tasks do
      load "tasks/api_boost_tasks.rake"
    end
  end
end
```

Create the Rake task file:

```ruby
# api_boost/lib/tasks/api_boost_tasks.rake

namespace :api_boost do
  desc "Show API usage statistics"
  task stats: :environment do
    puts "API Boost Statistics:"
    puts "Models using acts_as_api_resource: #{api_resource_models.count}"
  end

  def api_resource_models
    ApplicationRecord.descendants.select do |model|
      model.include?(ApiBoost::ActsAsApiResource)
    end
  end
end
```

Applications using your plugin will now have access to `rails api_boost:stats`.

### Testing the Railtie

You can test that your Railtie works correctly in the dummy application:

```ruby
# api_boost/test/railtie_test.rb

require "test_helper"

class RailtieTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_configuration_is_available
    assert_not_nil ApiBoost.configuration
    assert_equal 60.requests_per_hour, ApiBoost.configuration.default_rate_limit
  end

  def test_acts_as_api_resource_is_automatically_included
    assert Class.new(ApplicationRecord).include?(ApiBoost::ActsAsApiResource)
  end

  def test_rake_tasks_are_loaded
    Rails.application.load_tasks
    assert Rake::Task.task_defined?("api_boost:stats")
  end
end
```

Railties provide a clean way to integrate your plugin with Rails' initialization
process. For more details about the complete Rails initialization lifecycle, see
the [Rails Initialization Process Guide](initialization.html).

Testing Your Plugin
-------------------

It's good practice to add tests. The Rails
plugin generator created a test framework for you. Let's add tests for the
functionality we just built.

### Testing Core Extensions

Create a test file for your core extensions:

```ruby
# api_boost/test/core_ext_test.rb

require "test_helper"

class CoreExtTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_to_throttled_response_adds_rate_limit_header
    response_data = "Hello API"
    expected = { data: "Hello API", rate_limit: 60.requests_per_hour }
    assert_equal expected, response_data.to_throttled_response
  end

  def test_to_throttled_response_with_custom_limit
    response_data = "User data"
    expected = { data: "User data", rate_limit: "100 requests per hour" }
    assert_equal expected, response_data.to_throttled_response("100 requests per hour")
  end
end
```

### Testing Acts As Methods

Create a test file for your ActsAs functionality:

```ruby
# api_boost/test/acts_as_api_resource_test.rb

require "test_helper"

class ActsAsApiResourceTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_a_users_api_timestamp_field_should_be_last_requested_at
    assert_equal "last_requested_at", User.api_timestamp_field
  end

  def test_a_products_api_timestamp_field_should_be_last_api_call
    assert_equal "last_api_call", Product.api_timestamp_field
  end

  def test_users_track_api_request_should_populate_last_requested_at
    user = User.new
    freeze_time = Time.current
    Time.stub(:current, freeze_time) do
      user.track_api_request
      assert_equal freeze_time.to_s, user.last_requested_at.to_s
    end
  end

  def test_products_track_api_request_should_populate_last_api_call
    product = Product.new
    freeze_time = Time.current
    Time.stub(:current, freeze_time) do
      product.track_api_request
      assert_equal freeze_time.to_s, product.last_api_call.to_s
    end
  end
end
```

Run your tests to make sure everything is working:

```bash
$ bin/test
...
6 runs, 6 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Generators
----------

Generators can be included in your gem simply by creating them in a
`lib/generators` directory of your plugin. More information about the creation
of generators can be found in the [Generators Guide](generators.html).

Publishing Your Gem
-------------------

Gem plugins currently in development can easily be shared from any Git
repository. To share the ApiBoost gem with others, simply commit the code to a
Git repository (like GitHub) and add a line to the `Gemfile` of the application
in question:

```ruby
gem "api_boost", git: "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/api_boost.git"
```

After running `bundle install`, your gem functionality will be available to the
application.

When the gem is ready to be shared as a formal release, it can be published to
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org).

Alternatively, you can benefit from Bundler's Rake tasks. You can see a full
list with the following:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake -T

$ bundle exec rake build
# Build api_boost-0.1.0.gem into the pkg directory

$ bundle exec rake install
# Build and install api_boost-0.1.0.gem into system gems

$ bundle exec rake release
# Create tag v0.1.0 and build and push api_boost-0.1.0.gem to Rubygems
```

For more information about publishing gems to RubyGems, see: [Publishing your
gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/publishing).

RDoc Documentation
------------------

Once your plugin is stable, you can write documentation for it. The first step
is to update the `README.md` file with detailed information about how to use
your plugin. A few key things to include are:

* Your name
* How to install
* How to add the functionality to the app (several examples of common use cases)
* Warnings, gotchas or tips that might help users and save them time

Once your `README.md` is solid, go through and add RDoc comments to all the
methods that developers will use. It's also customary to add `# :nodoc:`
comments to those parts of the code that are not included in the public API.

Once your comments are good to go, navigate to your plugin directory and run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake rdoc
```
