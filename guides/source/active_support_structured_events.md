Active Support Structured Events
================================

Active Support provides a unified API for reporting *structured events* inside your application. A structured event is a
named record of something that occured in your application, including what happened, when, and from where. They form the
foundation for Rails' observability story and can be exported to any external provider.

This guide explains the concepts, design, and usage patterns behind structured events, and how Rails integrates them with framework instrumentation.

After reading this guide, you will understand:

* What structured events are and when to use them
* How Rails reports events
* How subscribers consume and export events
* How tags and context work
* Where to find the authoritative API definitions
* How to test structured events
* Framework events that Rails emits by default

-------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Structured Events
---------------------------------

Structured events are machine-friendly, semantically consistent records describing something that occurred in your application. They are designed for production observability, fast search, analytics platforms, and developer-facing diagnostic tools.

Each event contains:

* **name** - A string identifier for the event. When passing a string or symbol to `notify`, it's coerced to a string. When passing an event object, the class name is used (e.g., `"UserCreatedEvent"`).

* **payload** - The event data, which can be either:
  - A hash with symbolized keys (automatically filtered for sensitive parameters)
  - An event object (passed through as-is to subscribers for custom serialization)

* **timestamp** - A nanosecond-precision timestamp captured at event creation.

* **source_location** - Automatically captured metadata about where the event was emitted, containing:
  - `filepath`: The file path where `notify` was called
  - `lineno`: The line number
  - `label`: The method or context name (e.g., `"UserService#create"`)

* **tags** - Domain-specific metadata attached via the `tagged` method. Tags are fiber-local and stack-oriented, meaning nested `tagged` blocks accumulate tags.

* **context** - Request or job-scoped metadata set via `set_context`. Unlike tags, context persists across the entire request/job lifecycle until explicitly cleared.

```ruby
# Set context for the request
Rails.event.set_context(request_id: "abc123", user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0")

# Use tags for domain-specific context
Rails.event.tagged("graphql", query_type: "mutation") do
  # Emit event from UserService#create at line 42
  Rails.event.notify("user.created", { id: 456, email: "user@example.com" })
end

# Resulting event hash passed to subscribers:
# {
#   name: "user.created",
#   payload: { id: 456, email: "user@example.com" },
#   tags: { graphql: true, query_type: "mutation" },
#   context: { request_id: "abc123", user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0" },
#   timestamp: 1738964843208679035,
#   source_location: {
#     filepath: "/app/services/user_service.rb",
#     lineno: 42,
#     label: "UserService#create"
#   }
# }
```

Rails automatically attaches timestamp and source location information to events. Developers can use
tags and context to supply events with additional information. Individual events require a name and payload.

### Why Structured Events?

Rails already emits unstructured logs. They are ideal for development but become difficult and expensive to use in production. Some of the challenges of logs are as follows:

* logs from many threads and processes interleave, making it difficult to understand what's happening
* a lack of consistent schema requires specialized knowledge to query the logs
* indexing costs grow with volume

Structured events fix these problems as they:

* have a consistent shape
* have semantic naming and predictable payload keys
* are cheap to index in structured stores
* are easy to query
* are easily integrated with any Observability backend

They also unify **business events** and **developer observability events** behind a single API.
For example:

```ruby
# Business events represent domain-specific application logic
Rails.event.notify("order_created", order_id: 123, total: 99.99)
Rails.event.notify("payment_processed", transaction_id: "abc", amount: 49.99)
Rails.event.notify("user_signed_up", user_id: 456, plan: "premium")

# Developer observability events represent framework and system behavior
Rails.event.notify("sql.query", sql: "SELECT * FROM users", duration: 12.5)
Rails.event.notify("cache.hit", key: "user:123", store: "redis")
Rails.event.notify("request.completed", path: "/api/orders", status: 200)
```

Both event types use the same API and receive the same metadata (timestamp, source location, tags, context).

Reporting Events
----------------

The canonical entry point is `#notify`:

```ruby
Rails.event.notify("event.name", { id: 123 })
```

This attaches metadata and forwards the event to any configured subscribers.

For full method signatures and advanced options (debug, caller depth, filtering rules), see the [EventReporter API documentation][].

### Event Names

Event names should be descriptive and specific. A series of structured events should tell a good story about what happened.

```ruby
# Good
Rails.event.notify("order_created", order_id: order.id, shop_id: shop.id)
Rails.event.notify("payment_processed", amount: 49.99, currency: "USD")
Rails.event.notify("shipping_label_generated", carrier: "USPS")

# Avoid: Too generic or interpolated
Rails.event.notify("order", {})              # Too vague
Rails.event.notify("order_#{order.id}", {})  # String interpolation creates high cardinality
```

Names should reflect *what happened*, not how or why. Variable data belongs in the payload, not the event name.
Event names can be reused, but repeated events should represent the same "thing" conceptually.

### Event Payloads

Payloads are Ruby hashes containing event-specific attributes. Consider an order fulfillment workflow:

```ruby
# When an order is created
Rails.event.notify("order_created",
  order_id: order.id,
  shop_id: shop.id,
  total_amount: order.total_price,
  currency: order.currency,
  line_item_count: order.line_items.count
)

# When payment is processed
Rails.event.notify("payment_processed",
  order_id: order.id,
  payment_id: payment.id,
  amount: payment.amount,
  currency: payment.currency,
  gateway: payment.gateway_name,
  status: "captured"
)

# When shipping label is created
Rails.event.notify("shipping_label_generated",
  order_id: order.id,
  fulfillment_id: fulfillment.id,
  carrier: "USPS",
  tracking_number: fulfillment.tracking_number,
  shipping_method: "standard"
)
```

The resulting event includes automatically-attached metadata:

```ruby
# Emits event:
{
  name: "order_completed",
  payload: { order_id: 123, shipped_at: "2025-01-15 10:30:00 UTC" },
  timestamp: 1738964843208679035,
  source_location: {
    filepath: "app/services/fulfillment_service.rb",
    lineno: 45,
    label: "FulfillmentService#complete"
  }
}
```

#### Best Practices for Payload Design

* Use consistent attribute names across related events
* Include identifiers for correlation: `order_id`, `shop_id`, `user_id`
* Keep payloads focused, and only include relevant data
* Omit nil values
* Follow semantic conventions when available (e.g., OpenTelemetry)

Further details on object payloads and automatic key normalization can be found in the [Event Objects][] section of the API documentation.

### Debug Events

Debug events are emitted only when debug mode is enabled:

```ruby
# High-volume diagnostic information
Rails.event.debug("inventory_check_performed",
  order_id: order.id,
  sku: line_item.sku,
  available_quantity: inventory.quantity
)

# Expensive payload: only computed in debug mode
Rails.event.debug("large_data_exported",
  user_id: user.id,
  export_id: export.id
) do
  {
    exported_data: generate_large_export_data, # This could be computationally intensive
    record_count: export.items.count,
    export_time_ms: export.elapsed_time
  }
end
```

Debug events help diagnose issues in development or when explicitly enabled via `Rails.event.with_debug`.
For example:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  around_action :with_event_debug_if_requested

  private
    def with_event_debug_if_requested
      if params[:debug]
        Rails.event.with_debug(&block)
      else
        yield
      end
    end
end
```

With this setup in `ApplicationController`, any request with the `debug` query parameter (e.g., `?debug=1`) will execute inside `Rails.event.with_debug`. All `Rails.event.debug` events triggered during that request will be emitted.

This prevents high-volume diagnostic telemetry from flooding production logs by default.

Further details on debug events can be found in the [Debug Events][] section of the API documentation.

Subscribers
-----------

A subscriber receives events and is responsible for exporting them to a destination such as:

* a log file
* a streaming platform
* a metrics or analytics system
* a SaaS observability backend

Here's an example of a subscriber that exports order events to an analytics platform:

```ruby
class OrderAnalyticsSubscriber
  def emit(event)
    case event[:name]
    when "order_created", "order_completed", "payment_processed"
      AnalyticsPlatform.track(
        event_name: event[:name],
        timestamp: event[:timestamp],
        properties: event[:payload],
        source: event[:source_location]
      )
    end
  end
end

Rails.event.subscribe(OrderAnalyticsSubscriber.new)
```

Subscribers can also filter events to receive only specific types:

```ruby
Rails.event.subscribe(
  OrderAnalyticsSubscriber.new,
  filter: ->(event) { event[:name].start_with?("order_") }
)
```

Real-world subscriber implementations often:

* Batch events for efficiency
* Handle errors gracefully to avoid disrupting the application
* Perform async export to external systems
* Apply additional filtering or transformation

For more information on [Subscribers][] and [Filtered Subscriptions][], please see their respective sections within the Structured Events API documentation.

Tags
----

Tags annotate events with domain-specific labels that help categorize and filter events across your application. Use tags when you want to mark related events with categorical attributes without repeating them in every payload.

Here's an example tagging payment events by gateway and environment:

```ruby
class PaymentProcessor
  def charge(order)
    # Tag all payment-related events with the gateway being used
    Rails.event.tagged(gateway: payment_gateway.name) do
      Rails.event.notify("payment_processing_started",
        order_id: order.id,
        amount: order.total_price
      )

      result = payment_gateway.charge(order)

      if result.success?
        Rails.event.notify("payment_captured",
          order_id: order.id,
          transaction_id: result.transaction_id,
          amount: order.total_price
        )
      else
        Rails.event.notify("payment_declined",
          order_id: order.id,
          error_code: result.error_code
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

All three events receive the `gateway` tag, making it easy to filter payment events by gateway in your observability platform:

```json
{
  "name": "payment_captured",
  "tags": { "gateway": "stripe" },
  "payload": { "order_id": 123, "transaction_id": "ch_abc", "amount": 49.99 }
}
```

Tags are stack-based, meaning that they automatically clear when the block exits. Tags can also nest: when you enter a nested `tagged` block, the new tags are merged with outer tags and applied to events inside the block.

Further details on tags can be found in the [Tags][] section of the API documentation.

Context
-------

Context expresses execution-scoped metadata that should be attached to *all events* within a request, job, or other work unit. Unlike tags, which are block-scoped, context is set once and automatically flows through your entire application for the duration of that execution.

### Setting Context in Middleware

The most common pattern is setting context early in the request lifecycle, such as in Rack middleware:

```ruby
class EventContextMiddleware
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)

    # Set context once for the entire request
    Rails.event.set_context(
      request_id: request.request_id,
      shop_id: extract_shop_id(env),
      api_client_id: extract_api_client_id(env)
    )

    @app.call(env)
  end

  private
    def extract_shop_id(env)
      env["HTTP_X_SHOP_ID"]&.to_i
    end

    def extract_api_client_id(env)
      env["HTTP_X_API_CLIENT_ID"]&.to_i
    end
end
```

With this middleware in place, every event in your application automatically includes the context:

```ruby
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    order = Order.create!(order_params)

    Rails.event.notify("order_created",
      order_id: order.id,
      total_amount: order.total_price
    )
  end
end
```

```json
{
  "name": "order_created",
  "payload": { "order_id": 123, "total_amount": 49.99 },
  "context": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "shop_id": 456,
    "api_client_id": 789
  }
}
```

You can also set context for background jobs, ensuring that every event emitted during the job's execution includes
relevant job-scoped metadata such as the job ID or custom attributes. For example:

```ruby
class ExportOrdersJob < ApplicationJob
  before_perform do |job|
    Rails.event.set_context(job_id: job.job_id)
  end

  def perform(exporter, export_params)
    Rails.event.notify("orders.export.started", count: Order.count)
    # Perform export logic...
    Rails.event.notify("orders.export.finished", status: "ok")
  end
end
```

Which results in the following events when the job runs:

```json
{
  "name": "orders.export.started",
  "payload": { "count": 42 },
  "context": {
    "job_id": "abcd-1234"
  }
}
```

NOTE: Context is automatically reset between requests and jobs, ensuring complete isolation between work units.

### Context vs Payload

A key principle: **correlation IDs belong in context, business data belongs in the payload**.

```ruby
# Good: shop_id in context, order-specific data in payload
Rails.event.set_context(shop_id: current_shop.id, request_id: request.uuid)
Rails.event.notify("order_created",
  order_id: order.id,
  total_amount: order.total_price,
  currency: order.currency
)

# Avoid: Repeating shop_id in every event payload
Rails.event.notify("order_created",
  shop_id: current_shop.id,  # Should be in context
  order_id: order.id,
  total_amount: order.total_price
)
Rails.event.notify("payment_processed",
  shop_id: current_shop.id,  # Should be in context
  order_id: order.id,
  amount: 49.99
)
```

Further details on the context store can be found in the [Context Store][] section of the API documentation.

Testing Structured Events
-------------------------

To ensure that your application is emitting events as expected, you can use the built-in test helper [`ActiveSupport::Testing::EventReporterAssertions`][].

### Include the Helper

First, you must include the helper in your test case:

```ruby
class MyEventTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include ActiveSupport::Testing::EventReporterAssertions

  # Your tests go here
end
```

### Key Assertions

The helper provides several assertions to verify event emissions:

#### `assert_event_reported`

This assertion accepts an event name, an optional payload and tags hash, and a block.
It will pass if an event matching the criteria was reported during the block execution.

For example, to assert that an `order_created` event was reported with specific payload attributes:

```ruby
assert_event_reported("order_created", { order_id: 123, total_amount: 49.99 }) do
  OrderService.create_order(user: user, items: items)
end
```

#### `assert_events_reported`

Supports the same parameters as `assert_event_reported` but allows you to specify multiple expected events.

```ruby
assert_events_reported([
 { name: "user.created", payload: { id: 123 } },
 { name: "email.sent", payload: { to: "user@example.com" } }
]) do
  create_user_and_send_welcome_email
end
```

#### `assert_no_event_reported`

This assertion ensures that no event matching the specified name, payload, and tags was reported during the block execution.

```ruby
assert_no_event_reported("user.created") do
  service_that_does_not_report_events.perform
end
```

Alternatively you can test for the absence of any events by not providing a name:

```ruby
assert_no_event_reported do
  service_that_does_not_report_events.perform
end
```

### Matching Event Details

When specifying the payload and tags, you can use exact values or matchers like regular expressions.

```ruby
assert_event_reported("user.created",
  payload: { id: 123, name: "John Doe" },
  tags: { request_id: /[0-9]+/ }
) do
  Rails.event.tagged(request_id: "123") do
    Rails.event.notify("user.created", { id: 123, name: "John Doe" })
  end
end
```

The matchers support partial matching - only the specified keys need to match.

```ruby
assert_event_reported("user.created", payload: { id: 123 }) do
  Rails.event.notify("user.created", { id: 123, name: "John Doe" })
end
```

### Testing Debug Events

You can test [debug events](#debug-events) by wrapping your test code in `with_debug_event_reporting`.

```ruby
with_debug_event_reporting do
  service_that_reports_debug_events.perform
end
```

This will enable all debug events to be reported to `Rails.event` for the duration of the block, when used in conjunction with [`Rails.event.with_debug`][].


Security
--------

Hash-based payloads are filtered automatically using [`config.filter_parameters`][].

[Event objects][Event Objects] must be filtered by the subscriber, e.g. with [`ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter`][].

Structured Events respects your application's privacy settings by automatically filtering sensitive data from hash-based payloads using [`config.filter_parameters`][]. This means if you've set up filters for passwords, tokens, or credit card numbers elsewhere in your app, those same filters apply here.

However, if you're using [Event objects][Event Objects], you'll need to handle filtering yourself in your subscriber. You can use [`ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter`][] to apply the same filtering rules. This extra step with Event objects gives you full control over how data is filtered before it leaves your application, which is particularly important when exporting to external systems.
