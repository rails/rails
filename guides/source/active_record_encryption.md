Active Record Encryption
========================

This guide covers how to encrypt data in your database using Active Record.

After reading this guide, you will know:

* How to set up database encryption with Active Record.
* How to migrate unencrypted data.
* How to make different encryption schemes coexist.
* More about advanced concepts like Encryption Contexts and Key Providers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Active Record Encryption exists to protect sensitive information in your application, such as personally identifiable information (PII) about your users. Active Record supports application-level encryption by allowing you to declare which attributes should be encrypted. It enables transparent encryption and decryption of attributes when saving and retrieving data. The encryption layer sits between the application and the database.

## Why Encrypt Data at the Application Level?

Encrypting specific attributes at the application-level adds an additional security layer. For example, if someone gains access to your application logs or database backup, the encrypted data remains unreadable. It also helps avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information in your application console or logs.

Most importantly, this feature lets you explicitly define what data is sensitive in your code. This enables precise access control throughout your application and any connected services. For example, you can use tools like [console1984](https://github.com/basecamp/console1984) to restrict decrypted data access in the Rails console. You can also take advantage of automatic [parameter filtering](#filtering-params-named-as-encrypted-columns) for encrypted fields.

NOTE: Encryption requires extra space because the encrypted value will be larger
than the original value. This overhead is negligible at larger sizes. Active
Record Encryption also uses compression by default, which can offer up to 30%
storage savings over the unencrypted version for larger payloads.

## Setup

To start using Active Record Encryption, you need to generate keys and declare attributes you want to encrypt in the Model.

### Generate Encryption Key

You can generate a random key set by running `bin/rails db:encryption:init`:

```bash
$ bin/rails db:encryption:init
```

Then, add the keys to the credentials file of the target environment:

```yml
# config/credentials.yml
active_record_encryption:
  primary_key: EGY8WhulUOXixybod7ZWwMIL68R9o5kC
  deterministic_key: aPA5XyALhf75NNnMzaspW7akTfZp0lPY
  key_derivation_salt: xEY0dt6TZcAMg52K7O84wYzkjvbA62Hz
```

These values can be stored by copying and pasting the generated values into your existing [Rails credentials](/security.html#custom-credentials). Alternatively, these values can be configured from other sources, such as environment variables:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.primary_key = ENV["ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY"]
config.active_record.encryption.deterministic_key = ENV["ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_DETERMINISTIC_KEY"]
config.active_record.encryption.key_derivation_salt = ENV["ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT"]
```

NOTE: These generated values are 32 bytes in length. If you generate these
yourself, the minimum lengths you should use are 12 bytes for the primary key
and 20 bytes for the [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)).

Once the keys are generated and stored, you can start using Active Record Encryption by declaring attributes to be encrypted.

### Declare Encrypted Attributes

The [`encrypts` method](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/EncryptableRecord.html#method-i-encrypts) defines the attributes to be encrypted at the model level. These are regular Active Record attributes backed by a column with the same name.

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :title
end
```

Active Record Encryption will transparently encrypt these attributes before saving them to the database and will decrypt them upon retrieval. For example,

```ruby
article = Article.create title: "Encrypt it all!"
article.title # => "Encrypt it all!"
```

However, in the Rails console, the executed SQL looks like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO `articles` (`title`) VALUES ('{\"p\":\"n7J0/ol+a7DRMeaE\",\"h\":{\"iv\":\"DXZMDWUKfp3bg/Yu\",\"at\":\"X1/YjMHbHD4talgF9dt61A==\"}}')
```

The value inserted is the encrypted text for `article.title`.

### Querying Encrypted Data: Deterministic vs. Non-deterministic Encryption

By default, Active Record Encryption is non-deterministic, which means that encrypting the same value with the same key twice will result in *different* encrypted values (aka ciphertexts). The non-deterministic approach improves security by making crypto-analysis of ciphertexts harder. However, it also means that queries (such as `WHERE title = "Encrypt it all!"`) on encrypted values are not possible, since the same value can result in a different encrypted value that does not match the previously stored ciphertext.

If you need to query the encrypted `email` field on the `Author` model below, you can use deterministic encryption:

```ruby
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :email, deterministic: true
end

# You can only query by email if using deterministic encryption.
Author.find_by_email("tolkien@email.com")
```

The `deterministic:` option generates initialization vectors in a deterministic
way, meaning it will produce the same encrypted output given the same input
value. This makes querying encrypted attributes possible, like the `email`
above.

The `:deterministic` option allows for querying by trading off lesser security.
The data is still encrypted but the determinism makes crypto-analysis easier.
For this reason, non-deterministic encryption is recommended for all data unless
you need to query by an attribute.

NOTE: In non-deterministic mode, Active Record uses
[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)-[GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
with a 256-bits key and a random initialization vector. In deterministic mode,
it also uses AES-GCM, but the initialization vector is not random. It is generated as an a function of the key and the plaintext content ([HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)-SHA-256 digest of the two).

NOTE: If you do not define a `deterministic_key`, then you have effectively disabled deterministic encryption.

## Basic Usage

### Ignoring Case

You might need to ignore the case when querying deterministically encrypted data. Two approaches make accomplishing this easier:

You can use the `:downcase` option when declaring the encrypted attribute to downcase the content before encryption occurs.

```ruby
class Person
  encrypts :email_address, deterministic: true, downcase: true
end
```

When using `:downcase`, the original case is lost. In some situations, you might
want to ignore the case only when querying while also storing the original case.
For those situations, you can use the `:ignore_case` option. This requires you
to add a new column named `original_<column_name>` to store the content with the
case unchanged:

```ruby
class Label
  encrypts :name, deterministic: true, ignore_case: true # the content with the original case will be stored in the column `original_name`
end
```

### Serialized Attributes

By default, Active Record Encryption will serialize values using the underlying type before encrypting them as long as the value is serializable as Strings. If the underlying type is not serializable as a String, you can use a custom [`message_serializer`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/MessageSerializer.html):

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :metadata, message_serializer: SomeCustomMessageSerializer.new
end
```

Attributes with structured types using the [`serialized`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0.2/classes/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Serialization/ClassMethods.html#method-i-serialize) method are supported with encryption as well. The `serialized` method is used when you have an attribute that needs to be saved to the database as a serialized object (using `YAML`, `JSON` or such), and retrieved by deserializing into the same object.

WARNING: When using serialized attributes for custom types, the declaration of the serialized attribute should go **before** the encryption declaration:

```ruby
# CORRECT
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  serialize :title, type: Title
  encrypts :title
end

# INCORRECT
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :title
  serialize :title, type: Title
end
```

### Unique Constraints with Encrypted Data

Unique constraints are only supported with deterministically encrypted data.

#### Unique Validations

In order to support unique validations, you'll need to enable extended queries. The default value for this configuration is false:

```ruby
# config/applicaiton.rb
config.active_record.encryption.extend_queries = true
```

Then, the uniqueness constraint can be specified normally, along with encryption:

```ruby
class Person
  validates :email_address, uniqueness: true
  encrypts :email_address, deterministic: true, downcase: true
end
```

The `extended_queries` configuration also allows combining encrypted and unencrypted data, and when configuring previous encryption schemes.

NOTE: If you want to ignore the case, make sure to use the `downcase` or `ignore_case` option in the `encrypts` declaration. Using the `case_sensitive` option in the validation won't work.

#### Unique Indexes

In order to support unique indexes on deterministically encrypted columns, you need to make sure that their ciphertexts don't change.

One thing Rails does to help is that, by default, deterministic attributes will use the oldest available encryption scheme when multiple encryption schemes are configured.

```ruby
class Person
  encrypts :email_address, deterministic: true
end
```

In order for unique indexes to work, you will have to ensure that the encryption properties for the underlying attributes don't change.

### Filtering Params Named as Encrypted Columns

Encrypted columns are configured to be automatically [filtered](configuring.html#config-filter-parameters) in Rails logs. In case you need to disable filtering of encrypted parameters, you can use the following configuration:

```ruby
# config/applicaiton.rb
config.active_record.encryption.add_to_filter_parameters = false
```

When filtering is enabled, if you want to exclude specific columns from automatic filtering, you can use this configuration:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.excluded_from_filter_parameters = [:catchphrase]
```

NOTE: When generating the filter parameter, Rails will use the model name as a prefix. E.g: For `Person#name`, the filter parameter will be `person.name`.

### Action Text

You can encrypt Action Text attributes by passing `encrypted: true` in their declaration.

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  has_rich_text :content, encrypted: true
end
```

NOTE: Passing individual encryption options to Action Text attributes is not supported. It will use non-deterministic encryption with the global encryption options configured.

### Fixtures

You can get Rails fixtures encrypted automatically by adding this option to your `test.rb`:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.encrypt_fixtures = true
```

When enabled, all the encryptable attributes will be encrypted according to the encryption settings defined in the model.

#### Action Text Fixtures

To encrypt Action Text fixtures, you can place them in `fixtures/action_text/encrypted_rich_texts.yml`.

### Encoding

When encrypting strings non-deterministically, their original encoding is preserved automatically.

For deterministic encryption, Rails stores the string encoding alongside the ciphertext. However, to ensure consistent encryption output, especially for querying or enforcing uniqueness, the library forces UTF-8 encoding by default. This avoids producing different ciphertexts for identical strings with different encodings.

You can customize this behavior. To change the default forced encoding:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.forced_encoding_for_deterministic_encryption = Encoding::US_ASCII
```

To disable forced encoding and preserve the original encoding in all cases:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.forced_encoding_for_deterministic_encryption = nil
```

### Compression

Active Record Encryption compresses encrypted payloads by default. This can save up to 30% of the storage space for larger payloads.

You can disable compression by setting `compress` option when encrypting attributes:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :content, compress: false
end
```

You can also configure the algorithm used for the compression. The default compressor is `Zlib`. You can implement your own compressor by creating a class or module that responds to `deflate` and `inflate` methods. For example:

```ruby
require "zstd-ruby"

module ZstdCompressor
  def self.deflate(data)
    Zstd.compress(data)
  end

  def self.inflate(data)
    Zstd.decompress(data)
  end
end

class User
  encrypts :name, compressor: ZstdCompressor
end
```

You can also configure the desired compression method globally:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.compressor = ZstdCompressor
```

### Using the API

Active Record Encryption is meant to be used declaratively, but there is also an API for debugging or advance use cases.

You can encrypt and decrypt all relevant attributes of an `article` model like this:

```ruby
article.encrypt # encrypt or re-encrypt all the encryptable attributes
article.decrypt # decrypt all the encryptable attributes
```

You can check whether a given attribute is encrypted:

```ruby
article.encrypted_attribute?(:title)
```

You can read the `ciphertext` for an attribute:

```ruby
article.ciphertext_for(:title)
```

## Migrating Existing Data

### Support for Unencrypted Data

To ease the transition from unencrypted to encrypted attributes in your Rails application, you can enable support for unencrypted data with:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.support_unencrypted_data = true
```

When enabled:

* Reading attributes that are still unencrypted will succeed without raising errors.

* Queries on deterministically encrypted attributes can match both encrypted and cleartext values, if you also enable `extended_queries`:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.extend_queries = true
```

This setup is intended only for migration periods during which both encrypted and unencrypted data need to coexist in your application. Both options default to `false`, which is the recommended long-term configuration to ensure data is fully encrypted and enforced.

### Support for Previous Encryption Schemes

Changing encryption properties of attributes can break existing data. For example, imagine you want to make a deterministic attribute non-deterministic. If you change the declaration in the model, reading existing ciphertexts will fail because the encryption method is different now.

To support these situations, you can specify previous encryption schemes to be used globally or on a per-attribute basis.

Once you configure the previous scheme, the following will be supported:

* When reading encrypted data, Active Record Encryption will try previous encryption schemes if the current scheme doesn't work.

* When querying deterministic data, it will add ciphertexts using previous schemes so that queries work seamlessly with data encrypted with different schemes.

You need to enable `extended_queries` configuration for this to work:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.extend_queries = true
```

Next, let's see how to configure previous encryption schemes.

#### Global Previous Encryption Schemes

You can add previous encryption schemes by adding them as a list of properties using the `previous` config property in your `application.rb`:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.previous = [ { key_provider: MyOldKeyProvider.new } ]
```

#### Per-attribute Previous Encryption Schemes

Use the `previous` option when declaring the encrypted attribute:

```ruby
class Article
  encrypts :title, deterministic: true, previous: { deterministic: false }
end
```

#### Encryption Schemes and Determinism

With deterministic encryption, you typically want ciphertexts to remain constant. So when changing encryption schemes, non-deterministic and deterministic encryption behave differently.

* With **non-deterministic encryption**, new information will always be encrypted with the *newest* (current) encryption scheme.

* With **deterministic encryption**, new information will be encrypted with the *oldest* encryption scheme by default.

It is possible to change this behavior for deterministic encryption to use the *newest* encryption scheme for encrypting new data like this:

```ruby
class Article
  encrypts :title, deterministic: { fixed: false }
end
```

## Encryption Contexts

An encryption context defines the encryption components that are used at a given moment. There is a default encryption context based on your global configuration, but you can also configure a custom context for a given attribute or when running a specific block of code.

NOTE: Encryption contexts are a flexible but advanced configuration mechanism. Most users should not have to care about them.

The main components of encryption contexts are:

* `encryptor`: exposes the internal API for encrypting and decrypting data.  It interacts with a `key_provider` to build encrypted messages and deal with their serialization. The encryption/decryption itself is done by the `cipher` and the serialization by `message_serializer`.
* `cipher`: the encryption algorithm itself (AES 256 GCM).
* `key_provider`: serves encryption and decryption keys.
* `message_serializer`: serializes and deserializes encrypted payloads.

WARNING: If you decide to build your own `message_serializer`, it's important to use safe mechanisms that can't deserialize arbitrary objects. A commonly supported scenario is encrypting existing unencrypted data. An attacker can leverage this to enter a tampered payload before encryption takes place and perform RCE attacks. This means custom serializers should avoid `Marshal`, `YAML.load` (use `YAML.safe_load`  instead), or `JSON.load` (use `JSON.parse` instead).

### Built-In Encryption Context

The global encryption context is the one used by default and is configured with other configuration properties in your `application.rb` or environment config files.

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.key_provider = ActiveRecord::Encryption::EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider.new
config.active_record.encryption.encryptor = MyEncryptor.new
```

You can use [`with_encryption_context`](`https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/Contexts.html#method-i-with_encryption_context`) to override any of the properties of the encryption context.

### Encryption Context with a Block of Code

You can set an encryption context for a given block of code using `with_encryption_context`:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Encryption.with_encryption_context(encryptor: ActiveRecord::Encryption::NullEncryptor.new) do
  # ...
end
```

### Per-attribute Encryption Contexts

You can override encryption context configuration by passing options in the attribute declaration:

```ruby
class Attribute
  encrypts :title, encryptor: MyAttributeEncryptor.new
end
```

### Encryption Context to Disable Encryption

You can run code without encryption:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Encryption.without_encryption do
  # ...
end
```

This means that reading encrypted text will return the ciphertext, and saved content will be stored unencrypted.

### Encryption Context to Protect Encrypted Data

You can run code in a block without encryption but prevent overwriting encrypted content:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Encryption.protecting_encrypted_data do
  # ...
end
```

This can be handy if you want to protect encrypted data while running arbitrary code against it (e.g. in a Rails console).

## Key Management

Key providers implement key management strategies. You can configure key providers globally or on a per-attribute basis.

### Built-in Key Providers

#### DerivedSecretKeyProvider

The [`DerivedSecretKeyProvider`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/DerivedSecretKeyProvider.html) serves keys derived from the provided passwords using PBKDF2. This is the key provider configured by default.

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.key_provider = ActiveRecord::Encryption::DerivedSecretKeyProvider.new(["some passwords", "to derive keys from. ", "These should be in", "credentials"])
```

NOTE: By default, `active_record.encryption` configures a `DerivedSecretKeyProvider` with the keys defined in `active_record.encryption.primary_key`.

#### EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider

The [`EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider.html) implements a simple [envelope encryption](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption) strategy, where the data is encrypted with a key, which in turn is also encrypted.

The `EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider` generates a random key for each data encryption operation. It stores the data-key with the data itself. Then, the data-key is also encrypted with a primary key defined in the credential `active_record.encryption.primary_key`.

You can configure Active Record to use this key provider by adding this to your `application.rb`:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.key_provider = ActiveRecord::Encryption::EnvelopeEncryptionKeyProvider.new
```

As with other built-in key providers, you can provide a list of primary keys in `active_record.encryption.primary_key` to implement key-rotation schemes.

### Custom Key Providers

For more advanced key-management schemes, you can configure a custom key provider in an initializer:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Encryption.key_provider = MyKeyProvider.new
```

A key provider must implement this interface:

```ruby
class MyKeyProvider
  def encryption_key
  end

  def decryption_keys(encrypted_message)
  end
end
```

Both methods return `ActiveRecord::Encryption::Key` objects:

- `encryption_key` returns the key used for encrypting some content
- `decryption_keys` returns a list of potential keys for decrypting a given ciphertext.

A key can include arbitrary tags that will be stored unencrypted with the message. You can use [`ActiveRecord::Encryption::Message#headers`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Encryption/Message.html) to examine those values when decrypting.

### Attribute-specific Key Providers

You can configure a key provider on a per-attribute basis with the `key_provider` option. For example, assuming you have defined a custom key provider called `ArticleKeyProvider`:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :summary, key_provider: ArticleKeyProvider.new
end
```

### Attribute-specific Keys

You can configure a specific key for a given attribute using the `key` option:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  encrypts :summary, key: "some secret key for article summaries"
end
```

Active Record will use the key passed to `encrypts` to encrypt and decrypt the `summary` attribute above.

### Rotating Keys

Active Record Encryption can work with lists of keys to support implementing key rotation schemes. In the example below, the *last key* is used for encrypting new content and all keys are tried when decrypting content until one works.

```yml
active_record_encryption:
  primary_key:
    - a1cc4d7b9f420e40a337b9e68c5ecec6 # Previous keys can still decrypt existing content
    - bc17e7b413fd4720716a7633027f8cc4 # Active, encrypts new content
  key_derivation_salt: a3226b97b3b2f8372d1fc6d497a0c0d3
```

This enables key rotation workflow where you keep a short list of keys by adding new keys, re-encrypting content, and deleting old keys.

NOTE: Rotating keys is not supported for deterministic encryption.

### Storing Key References

You can store a reference to the encryption key in the encrypted message itself. The advantage of doing this is that decryption can be more performant as the system does not have to try a list of keys to find one that works. The tradeoff is that the encryption data will be a bit larger.

In order to store a key reference, you need to enable this configuration:

```ruby
config.active_record.encryption.store_key_references = true
```

## Configuration

### Configuration Options

You can configure Active Record Encryption options in your `application.rb` (most common scenario) or in a specific environment config file `config/environments/<env name>.rb` if you want to set them on a per-environment basis.

WARNING: It's recommended to use Rails built-in credentials support to store keys. If you prefer to set them manually via config properties, make sure you don't commit them with your code (e.g. use environment variables).

#### `config.active_record.encryption.support_unencrypted_data`

When true, unencrypted data can be read normally. When false, it will raise errors. Default: `false`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.extend_queries`

When true, queries referencing deterministically encrypted attributes will be modified to include additional values if needed. Those additional values will be the clean version of the value (when `config.active_record.encryption.support_unencrypted_data` is true) and values encrypted with previous encryption schemes, if any (as provided with the `previous:` option). Default: `false` (experimental).

#### `config.active_record.encryption.encrypt_fixtures`

When true, encryptable attributes in fixtures will be automatically encrypted when loaded. Default: `false`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.store_key_references`

When true, a reference to the encryption key is stored in the headers of the encrypted message. This makes for faster decryption when multiple keys are in use. Default: `false`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.add_to_filter_parameters`

When true, encrypted attribute names are added automatically to [`config.filter_parameters`][] and won't be shown in logs. Default: `true`.

[`config.filter_parameters`]: configuring.html#config-filter-parameters

#### `config.active_record.encryption.excluded_from_filter_parameters`

You can configure a list of params that won't be filtered out when `config.active_record.encryption.add_to_filter_parameters` is true. Default: `[]`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.validate_column_size`

Adds a validation based on the column size. This is recommended to prevent storing huge values using highly compressible payloads. Default: `true`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.primary_key`

The key or lists of keys used to derive root data-encryption keys. The way they are used depends on the key provider configured. It's preferred to configure it via the `active_record_encryption.primary_key` credential.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.deterministic_key`

The key or list of keys used for deterministic encryption. It's preferred to configure it via the `active_record_encryption.deterministic_key` credential.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.key_derivation_salt`

The salt used when deriving keys. It's preferred to configure it via the `active_record_encryption.key_derivation_salt` credential.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.forced_encoding_for_deterministic_encryption`

The default encoding for attributes encrypted deterministically. You can disable forced encoding by setting this option to `nil`. It's `Encoding::UTF_8` by default.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class`

The digest algorithm used to derive keys. `OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256` by default.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.support_sha1_for_non_deterministic_encryption`

Supports decrypting data encrypted non-deterministically with a digest class SHA1. The default is false, which
means it will only support the digest algorithm configured in `config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class`.

#### `config.active_record.encryption.compressor`

The compressor used to compress encrypted payloads. It should respond to `deflate` and `inflate`. The default is `Zlib`. You can find more information about compressors in the [Compression](#compression) section.
