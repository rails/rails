*   The guide _Classic to Zeitwerk HOWTO_ that documented how to migrate from
    the `classic` autoloader to Zeitwerk has been deleted.

    The last version of this guide can be found
    [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.2/classic_to_zeitwerk_howto.html),
    in case you need it.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   The guide _Active Record Multiple Databases_ has been updated to explain that
    when you switch to a multi database setup, the DATABASE_URL environment
    variable is no longer automatically used for the primary database.
