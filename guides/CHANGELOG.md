*   Update example of passing a proc to `:message` option for validating records.

    This behavior was recently changed in [Pull Request #24199](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24119) to
    pass the object being validated as first argument to the `:message` proc,
    instead of the key of the field being validated.
