== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

If you plan to generate application documentation with `rake doc:app` this file
is expected to be `README.rdoc`, otherwise please feel free to rename it and use
a different markup language.
