## Rails 5.0.7.1 (November 27, 2018) ##

*   Do not deserialize GlobalID objects that were not generated by Active Job.

    Trusting any GlobaID object when deserializing jobs can allow attackers to access
    information that should not be accessible to them.

    Fix CVE-2018-16476.

## Rails 5.0.1.rc1 (December 01, 2016) ##

*   Added instance variable `@queue` to JobWrapper.

    This will fix issues in [resque-scheduler](https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler) `#job_to_hash` method,
    so we can use `#enqueue_delayed_selection`, `#remove_delayed` method in resque-scheduler smoothly.

## Rails 5.0.0 (June 30, 2016) ##

*   Enable class reloading prior to job dispatch, and ensure Active Record
    connections are returned to the pool when jobs are run in separate threads.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   Tune the async adapter for low-footprint dev/test usage. Use a single
    thread pool for all queues and limit to 0 to #CPU total threads, down from
    2 to 10*#CPU per queue.

    *Jeremy Daer*

*   Change the default adapter from inline to async. It's a better default as tests will then not mistakenly
    come to rely on behavior happening synchronously. This is especially important with things like jobs kicked off
    in Active Record lifecycle callbacks.

    *DHH*

*   Fixed serializing `:at` option for `assert_enqueued_with`
    and `assert_performed_with`.

    *Wojciech Wnętrzak*

*   Support passing array to `assert_enqueued_jobs` in `:only` option.

    *Wojciech Wnętrzak*

*   Add job priorities to Active Job.

    *wvengen*

*   Implement a simple `AsyncJob` processor and associated `AsyncAdapter` that
    queue jobs to a `concurrent-ruby` thread pool.

    *Jerry D'Antonio*

*   Implement `provider_job_id` for `queue_classic` adapter. This requires the
    latest, currently unreleased, version of queue_classic.

    *Yves Senn*

*   `assert_enqueued_with` and `assert_performed_with` now returns the matched
    job instance for further assertions.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Include `I18n.locale` into job serialization/deserialization and use it around
    `perform`.

    Fixes #20799.

    *Johannes Opper*

*   Allow `DelayedJob`, `Sidekiq`, `qu`, and `que` to report the job id back to
    `ActiveJob::Base` as `provider_job_id`.

    Fixes #18821.

    *Kevin Deisz*, *Jeroen van Baarsen*

*   `assert_enqueued_jobs` and `assert_performed_jobs` in block form use the
    given number as expected value. This makes the error message much easier to
    understand.

    *y-yagi*

*   A generated job now inherits from `app/jobs/application_job.rb` by default.

    *Jeroen van Baarsen*

*   Add ability to configure the queue adapter on a per job basis.

    Now different jobs can have different queue adapters without conflicting with
    each other.

    Example:

        class EmailJob < ActiveJob::Base
          self.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
        end

        class ImageProcessingJob < ActiveJob::Base
          self.queue_adapter = :delayed_job
        end

    *tamird*

*   Add an `:only` option to `perform_enqueued_jobs` to filter jobs based on
    type.

    This allows specific jobs to be tested, while preventing others from
    being performed unnecessarily.

    Example:

        def test_hello_job
          assert_performed_jobs 1, only: HelloJob do
            HelloJob.perform_later('jeremy')
            LoggingJob.perform_later
          end
        end

    An array may also be specified, to support testing multiple jobs.

    Example:

        def test_hello_and_logging_jobs
          assert_nothing_raised do
            assert_performed_jobs 2, only: [HelloJob, LoggingJob] do
              HelloJob.perform_later('jeremy')
              LoggingJob.perform_later('stewie')
              RescueJob.perform_later('david')
            end
          end
        end

    Fixes #18802.

    *Michael Ryan*

*   Allow keyword arguments to be used with Active Job.

    Fixes #18741.

    *Sean Griffin*

*   Add `:only` option to `assert_enqueued_jobs`, to check the number of times
    a specific kind of job is enqueued.

    Example:

        def test_logging_job
          assert_enqueued_jobs 1, only: LoggingJob do
            LoggingJob.perform_later
            HelloJob.perform_later('jeremy')
          end
        end

    *George Claghorn*

*   `ActiveJob::Base.deserialize` delegates to the job class.

    Since `ActiveJob::Base#deserialize` can be overridden by subclasses (like
    `ActiveJob::Base#serialize`) this allows jobs to attach arbitrary metadata
    when they get serialized and read it back when they get performed.

    Example:

        class DeliverWebhookJob < ActiveJob::Base
          def serialize
            super.merge('attempt_number' => (@attempt_number || 0) + 1)
          end

          def deserialize(job_data)
            super
            @attempt_number = job_data['attempt_number']
          end

          rescue_from(TimeoutError) do |exception|
            raise exception if @attempt_number > 5
            retry_job(wait: 10)
          end
        end
