  # Active Job provides hooks during the life cycle of a job. Callbacks allow you
  # to trigger logic during this cycle. Available callbacks are:
  #
  # * <tt>before_enqueue</tt>
  # * <tt>around_enqueue</tt>
  # * <tt>after_enqueue</tt>
  # * <tt>before_perform</tt>
  # * <tt>around_perform</tt>
  # * <tt>after_perform</tt>
