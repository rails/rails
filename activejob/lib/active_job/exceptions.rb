    end

    module ClassMethods
      # Catch the exception and reschedule job for re-execution after so many seconds, for a specific number of attempts.
      # If the exception keeps getting raised beyond the specified number of attempts, the exception is allowed to
      # bubble up to the underlying queuing system, which may have its own retry mechanism or place it in a
      # holding queue for inspection.
      #
      # You can also pass a block that'll be invoked if the retry attempts fail for custom logic rather than letting
      # the exception bubble up. This block is yielded with the job instance as the first and the error instance as the second parameter.
      #
      # +retry_on+ and +discard_on+ handlers are searched from bottom to top, and up the class hierarchy. The handler of the first class for
      # which <tt>exception.is_a?(klass)</tt> holds true is the one invoked, if any.
      #
      # ==== Options
      # * <tt>:wait</tt> - Re-enqueues the job with a delay specified either in seconds (default: 3 seconds),
      #   as a computing proc that takes the number of executions so far as an argument, or as a symbol reference of
      #   <tt>:polynomially_longer</tt>, which applies the wait algorithm of <tt>((executions**4) + (Kernel.rand * (executions**4) * jitter)) + 2</tt>
      #   (first wait ~3s, then ~18s, then ~83s, etc)
      # * <tt>:attempts</tt> - Enqueues the job the specified number of times (default: 5 attempts) or a symbol reference of <tt>:unlimited</tt>
      #   to retry the job until it succeeds. The number of attempts includes the original job execution.
      # * <tt>:queue</tt> - Re-enqueues the job on a different queue
      # * <tt>:priority</tt> - Re-enqueues the job with a different priority
      # * <tt>:jitter</tt> - A random delay of wait time used when calculating backoff. The default is 15% (0.15) which represents the upper bound of possible wait time (expressed as a percentage)
